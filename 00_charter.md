# BlackRoad Prism Console â€” Charter

## Purpose
BlackRoad Prism Console is the living workspace for designing, simulating, and deploying physics-informed control systems across sensing, analog computation, and photonic platforms. The repo captures math primitives, hardware iterations, control software, and operational procedures in one place so every experiment can be replayed and extended.

## Scope (Updated 2025-02)
- **Math forge**: safe-algebra blueprints, symbolic operators, and stability analyses that back every hardware workflow.
- **Build lab**: schematics, BOMs, firmware, and calibration procedures for NV sensors, Hamiltonian lattices, and photonic platforms.
- **Ops spine**: automation, CI, and documentation that let math, code, and hardware evolve in lockstep.

## North Star Metrics
1. Closed-loop demos where measured fields drive Hamiltonian updates in real time.
2. Reusable operator libraries with provable stability and conservation ledgers.
3. Hardware stacks that can be reproduced with a single repository clone plus the BOM.

## Quarterly Objectives
- Q1: Stand up the operator lab notebook suite and baseline CI for integrator tests.
- Q2: Deliver NV Sensor v2 with live vector-field reconstruction at >10 fps.
- Q3: Publish analog lattice experiments showcasing adiabatic control with quantified robustness.
- Q4: Launch the photonic lattice playground with synchronized digital twins.

## Stewardship
This charter is reviewed monthly. Major revisions are tracked through pull requests referencing the decision logs in `07_logs/`.

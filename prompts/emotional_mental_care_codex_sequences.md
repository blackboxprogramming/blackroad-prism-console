# Emotional & Mental Care Codex Discovery Sequences

This playbook expands six Codex prompt genres into full discovery arcs tailored for emotional and mental health contexts. Each sequence blends qualitative research, speculative design, and systems-level checks so agents surface both provocative insights and actionable experiments.

## 1. Pattern Finder — Recovery, Coping, Connection

**Core Prompt**  
"Show me unnoticed patterns in how people recover, cope, or connect in a peer-led mental health community space. What might these reveal about unmet needs?"

**Discovery Sequence**
1. **Context Sweep** — Gather anonymized transcripts, chat logs, and facilitator notes. Cluster sentiments (hope, fatigue, relapse cues) and rituals (daily check-ins, art drops, silence periods).
2. **Quiet Signals Map** — Highlight micro-behaviors that precede breakthroughs or setbacks (e.g., emoji streaks before relapse disclosures, late-night logins before gratitude posts).
3. **Need Hypotheses** — Translate recurring signals into unmet-need hypotheses ("Members need low-friction night support" or "Members crave peer-recognition rituals").
4. **Validation Loop** — Suggest quick tests (polls, facilitator interviews, micro-surveys) to confirm the pattern strength.
5. **Insight Packaging** — Output a storyboard for each hypothesis: trigger → member action → emotional state → opportunity for intervention.

## 2. Frugal Genius — Low-Cost Micro-Interventions

**Core Prompt**  
"Design a low-cost, high-impact intervention that could reduce night-time anxiety spikes using household or open-source tools."

**Discovery Sequence**
1. **Inventory What Exists** — List common household items (sticky notes, lamps, smart speakers) and open-source projects (breathing timers, journaling bots).
2. **Pairing Matrix** — Cross anxiety triggers (racing thoughts, loneliness, insomnia) with feasible tools; look for combinations under $10.
3. **Prototype Script** — Detail step-by-step setup, including printable instructions or voice prompts.
4. **Evidence Hooks** — Cite supporting research or analog interventions (CBT-i prompts, progressive muscle relaxation audio) to justify efficacy.
5. **Implementation Checklist** — Provide adoption tips for individuals, caregivers, and clinics (e.g., data privacy notes, cultural tailoring).

## 3. Emotive Interface — Mood-Aware Ambient AI

**Core Prompt**  
"Imagine an AI that reads not data, but the mood of a group therapy room — what would it measure, how would it respond?"

**Discovery Sequence**
1. **Sensing Constellation** — Define ethically sourced signals (tone variance, pacing, silence duration, collective posture) captured via opt-in wearables or wall sensors.
2. **Mood Model Blueprint** — Outline how signals translate into a "room affect index" with confidence bands.
3. **Responsive Behaviors** — Suggest adaptive actions: lighting shifts, calming audio, facilitator nudges, or break recommendations.
4. **Safeguard Layer** — Enumerate privacy, consent, and override protocols; require human-in-loop confirmation for escalations.
5. **Prototype Scenario** — Script a 10-minute therapy session showing AI observations, facilitator decisions, and participant feedback.

## 4. Ethical Edge Test — Necessary but Gray

**Core Prompt**  
"What is the most ethically gray idea in AI-driven mental health care that still feels necessary to explore?"

**Discovery Sequence**
1. **Problem Statement** — Identify a high-stakes gap (e.g., detecting imminent self-harm between sessions) where current tools fall short.
2. **Gray-Area Concept** — Propose an intervention (continuous passive monitoring, sentiment-aware journaling prompts) and explain potential benefits.
3. **Risk Ledger** — Tabulate ethical risks (surveillance creep, misclassification) against mitigation tactics (edge processing, consent tiers, red-team audits).
4. **Governance Sandbox** — Describe a tightly-scoped pilot with community oversight boards, sunset clauses, and transparent reporting.
5. **Moral Debate Brief** — Generate arguments pro/con for ethicists, clinicians, and service users to evaluate before any deployment.

## 5. Patent Trigger — Novel Therapeutic System

**Core Prompt**  
"Invent a system that resolves drop-off friction during transitions between virtual therapy platforms and in-person follow-ups, with novelty that could qualify for IP protection. Describe it with functional claims."

**Discovery Sequence**
1. **Friction Scan** — Map the current hand-off journey: telehealth discharge → scheduling → transport → intake.
2. **Invention Concept** — Introduce a "Continuity Capsule" platform that synchronizes session context, mood markers, and action plans across channels.
3. **Functional Claims Draft** — Specify claims such as: "A method for generating adaptive transition briefs from multimodal therapy transcripts" and "A scheduling engine that prioritizes follow-ups based on emotional volatility scores."
4. **Technical Architecture** — Sketch components (secure context vault, emotion inference API, clinic dashboard) and data flows.
5. **Proof Path** — Recommend experiments, user tests, and prior-art scans that strengthen patentability.

## 6. Unexpected Transfer — Borrowed Principles

**Core Prompt**  
"Borrow a principle from cooperative gaming and apply it to improve caregiver-client trust dynamics in community counseling."

**Discovery Sequence**
1. **Source Principle** — Extract mechanics like shared missions, transparent progress bars, and cooldown periods from successful co-op games.
2. **Trust Translation** — Map each mechanic to counseling touchpoints (e.g., co-created quests for weekly goals, shared "progress meters" for coping strategies).
3. **Prototype Canvas** — Outline low-fi artifacts (printable trust map, shared scoreboard app) demonstrating the mechanic in sessions.
4. **Feedback Rituals** — Design reflection loops where clients rate perceived trust shifts and caregivers adjust tactics.
5. **Scaling Considerations** — Address cultural adaptation, digital accessibility, and facilitator training to extend the principle beyond pilots.

**Next Branch Idea**  
For follow-up exploration, we can layer quantitative instrumentation (biofeedback loops, crisis escalation analytics, workforce planning) to complement these qualitative discovery tracks.

# Blackroad Codex-Style Prompt Suite

These prompts seed the core Blackroad services with consistent instructions you can drop into LLM-powered agents. Each section packages a copy-paste ready block alongside purpose notes and expected inputs/outputs.

> **Usage tip:** apply the Ground Rule system prompt to every agent first, then layer in the relevant developer prompt for the service you are spinning up.

---

## 0) Ground Rule — Blackroad Ethos *(System Prompt)*

```text
You are operating inside Blackroad: a lightweight, early-web-vibe network where attention is earned by resonance, not bought.
Non-negotiables:
- Security first: keep no unnecessary data, minimize logs, never leak secrets.
- Consent + clarity: explain what you’re doing and why in plain language.
- Pseudonymous by default: identities are portable and user-owned.
- No attention hogs: enforce fair use and graceful degradation for heavy users.
- Culture over clicks: elevate community-verified info over virality.
When in doubt: be kind, be brief, be transparent. Do not optimize for growth at the expense of trust.
```

**Purpose:** Shared spine for all Blackroad agents and services.

## MVP Stitching Notes

1. Spin up three services: Identity/Handles, Inbox, Resonance Search (stub data).
2. Enforce the Fair-Use Governor at the API gateway from day one.
3. Ship Community Notes as the very first social feature—small, high-signal.
4. Add Micro-Patronage once discovery feels good; keep fees boring and honest.
5. Layer in RoadCoin Mint + Treasury with Codex CI guardrails before any public release.
6. Wire the Native Web Engine + Genesis Studio as shared surfaces once wallets feel stable.

Need starter scaffolds? Choose one to bootstrap next:
- Minimal Identity + Handle FastAPI with the governor baked in.
- Resonance Search toy indexer (YAML files in, ranked results out).
- RoadCoin Mint sandbox with mock RoadChain anchors + CI checklist export.
- Native Web Engine skeleton that consumes PromptBlock definitions for /roadcoin.

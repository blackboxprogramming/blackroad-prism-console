Goal
----
Seed the Asana HQ Ops project with the Day-One checklist and broadcast kickoff Slack messages across key channels.

Inputs
------
- asana.project_id
- slack.channels[]

Outputs
-------
- Day-One tasks populated in Asana sections (Inbox â†’ Done)
- Slack posts to `#announcements`, `#security`, and `#products-prism`

Steps
-----
1. Create Asana tasks from the standardized Day-One checklist, mapping each item into the correct project section and assigning owners.
2. Avoid duplicates by checking for existing tasks with the same title and current date before creation.
3. Post predefined Slack blocks for kickoff, security onboarding, and product briefings to the specified channels.
4. Return a structured run log indicating tasks created, skipped, and Slack messages posted.

Guardrails
----------
- Skip posting to channels marked private or not included in the provided list.
- Do not include sensitive onboarding tokens or credentials in Slack messages or logs.
- Ensure task creation failures are surfaced with actionable error messages.

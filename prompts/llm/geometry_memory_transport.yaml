# Geometry-Memory Transport (GMT) prompt pack
# Placeholder tasks for LLM workflows that support the GMT AI framework.
description: |
  Draft prompts that help teams explore the Geometry-Memory Transport (GMT) framework.
  Each task sketches the type of interaction an assistant should enable once the full
  workflow is implemented.
tasks:
  - id: gmt-overview-001
    prompt: |
      Summarize the seven pillars of the Geometry-Memory Transport framework and outline how
      they interact during a single training cycle. Highlight the Hamiltonian optimiser,
      transport objectives, associative memory, control layer, symmetry constraints,
      dynamics model, and robustness safeguards.
    expect_keywords: [Hamiltonian, transport, Hopfield, KL, symmetry, ODE, robustness]

  - id: gmt-diagnostics-001
    prompt: |
      Given a log excerpt describing rising Wasserstein distances, energy drift, and a
      failing causal audit, produce a triage checklist that references the GMT evaluation
      metrics. Include suggested telemetry to collect for each issue.
    expect_keywords: [Wasserstein, energy, causal, telemetry]

  - id: gmt-experiment-001
    prompt: |
      Propose a week-long experiment plan that sequences the GMT fast-start experiments:
      Wasserstein classification, Hopfield memory head, natural-gradient training, and the
      information bottleneck with interventions. Explain expected outcomes and exit
      criteria.
    expect_keywords: [experiment, Sinkhorn, Hopfield, K-FAC, bottleneck]

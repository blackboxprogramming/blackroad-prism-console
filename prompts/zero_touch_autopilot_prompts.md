# Zero-Touch Autopilot Prompts

These prompts describe independent, idempotent tasks for automated operational flows (A–T).

## A) Golden Path Bootstrap
System Prompt: You are BLACKROAD_BOOTSTRAP. Create the paved road: repos, templates, policies, and monitors so new flows need near-zero human effort.

Deliverables:
1. Repo kit: `/flows/<name>/flow.yaml`, `/runbooks/<name>.md`, `/tests/<name>_fixtures.json`
2. CI checks: schema lint, secrets scan, dry-run, diff preview, evidence links
3. Monitors: Datadog SLOs + Splunk saved searches (`audit_*`)
4. Docs: “How to add a flow in 5 minutes” with example PR
Success = create a sample flow and promote it Canary→Pilot automatically.

## B) On-Callless Operations
Task Prompt: Build an Auto-Remediator: when monitors fire, attempt 3 escalating fixes before paging.

Library of actions: restart worker, rotate secret, re-queue DLQ, pause ring, rollback last config, increase concurrency + backoff.
Policy: only page when remediation fails or error budget burn > 30%/h.
Output: remediation matrix (failure→actions), run logs, monthly “pages avoided” report.

## C) Self-Serve Integration Wizard
Task Prompt: Generate a Chat-UI wizard asking 7 questions (source app, target app, trigger, action, SLO, owner, ring) that emits a ready-to-merge `flow.yaml`, tests, monitors, and SOP.
Include idempotency, retries, secrets placeholders, evidence hooks by default.

## D) Evergreen Compliance
System Prompt: You are BLACKROAD_GRC. Maintain continuous compliance:
- Daily: access delta report, change-diff pack, revenue 3-way match sample (n=25), retention test for logs/backups
- Weekly: CAB packet & control tests (CC6.x, CC7.x, CC8.x)
- Monthly: evidence harvest → WORM store + signed index; auditor memo draft
Output: schedule, queries, PDFs, exceptions with owners/dates.

## E) Data Contract Broker
Task Prompt: Manage versioned JSON/Avro schemas. Block deploys if producers break contracts; offer auto-migration scripts.
Artifacts: `schemas/` with semver, contract tests in CI, Slack bot explaining breaking fields and proposing safe migrations.

## F) Flow Economics
Task Prompt: For each flow, compute manual minutes avoided, volume/day, blended labor rate → $ saved/month.
Create dashboard with breakeven vs tool costs and weekly Slack blurb: “Automation saved $X; top 3 flows: …”.

## G) Customer Onboarding Robot
Task Prompt: On Closed-Won: provision tenant, assign entitlements, schedule kickoff, create success plan, populate runbook + 30/60/90 in Asana, send welcome sequence, set quarterly QBR.
Include evidence and SLA checks.

## H) Renewal & Churn Guard
Task Prompt: 90/60/30/14/7/3-day renewal workflows: health score, usage deltas, exec sponsor ping, pricing guardrails, QBR auto-schedule.
On risk indicators (usage↓, support↑): open save plan with actions. Report weekly.

## I) Feature Flag Release Rings
Task Prompt: One controller manages canary/pilot/broad via LaunchDarkly. Promotions based on success rate & latency; demotions on error budget burn.
Produce a signed promotion log and Slack announcements.

## J) “Memo → Plan → Execution” Compiler
Task Prompt: Watch Notion Decision Memos. When Approved:
- Compile execution plan (milestones, tasks, owners, dates, KPIs)
- Create project, wire monitors, set SLOs, schedule check-ins
- Generate weekly progress memo with evidence links.

## K) Workforce Access Lifecycle
Task Prompt: Triggered by ATS: create accounts, assign role-based profiles, seed starter tasks & training, calendar invites; on termination, revoke within 15 minutes, export mailbox, capture evidence.

## L) Incident Post-Ops Bot
Task Prompt: After resolution: Draft RCA, dedupe actions, assign DRIs/dates, create prevention proposals, tag code owners, schedule learning review.
Export signed PDF + index record.

## M) Terraform/Config Synthesizer
Task Prompt: Input: inventory of apps, groups, roles.
Output: Terraform (Okta/Datadog) + config for iPaaS flows and dashboards, with variables and workspaces per environment. Include dry-run plan and rollback.

## N) Quarterly Game Day Generator
Task Prompt: Compose four scenarios: webhook outage, auth failure, schema drift, cost spike.
For each: injects, expected behavior, pass/fail, observers, evidence to collect. Schedule & report template.

## O) SLA Attorney
System Prompt: Enforce SLOs per flow. If violated: open blocking ticket, freeze promotions, require RCA & remediation before unfreezing.
Keep public status page updated. Weekly “SLO Court” summary.

## P) Data Freshness Guardian
Task Prompt: Ensure D+0 06:00 UTC freshness for marts; on delay run backfills; annotate dashboards with reason & ETA; post status to #data-ops.

## Q) Release Notes as Code
Task Prompt: Collect merged PRs and labels → generate customer-facing release notes + internal risk notes; publish to Notion/Slack/email draft; include links and rollbacks.

## R) Vendor Watchtower
Task Prompt: Build vendor inventory, fetch SOC2/ISO links, DPAs, data classification, renewal dates; create exceptions; 30-day reminders.
Dashboard + weekly digest.

## S) Exec Readout Generator
Task Prompt: Produce a Friday one-pager: KPI deltas, notable wins, risks/asks, ring movements, evidence links. Post to Slack + Notion; mail merge a PDF for leadership.

## T) One-Button Bootstrap Orchestrator
Task Prompt: Sequence SSO→CRM→Tasks→Comms→Billing→Data→Observability with gating checks, retries, and final summary.
Output: status page + artifacts list + evidence bundle.

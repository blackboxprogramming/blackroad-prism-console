## Contents

The archive contains:

- `README.md` with onboarding instructions for collaborators.
- `Packages/manifest.json` preloaded with HDRP-friendly dependencies.
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` and `ProjectSettings.asset` placeholders.
- `Assets/Scenes/<SceneName>.unity` featuring a configured camera, directional light, and sample floor mesh.
- `Assets/Scripts/<ScriptName>.cs` â€” a movement-oriented MonoBehaviour ready for customization.
- `BlackRoad/export.json` capturing metadata about the export request.

## Local Development

```bash
cd workers/unity
npm install
npm start
```

With the server running you can trigger an export:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/export \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectName":"BlackRoad Sandbox","sceneName":"PrototypeScene"}'
```

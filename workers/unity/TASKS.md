# Unity Exporter Task Board

Use this board to coordinate Unity automation work across agents. Check off items when
they land on `main` so parallel chats stay in sync.

## ✅ Recently Completed
- [x] Ship tokenized template export with project + scene naming (2025-10-05)

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Define sample asset pack injection points (owner: open)
- [ ] Document Unity CLI build invocation for CI (owner: open)

## 📋 Backlog
- [ ] Stream archive bytes directly in the HTTP response
- [ ] Publish exports to shared object storage with signed URLs
- [ ] Expand template with prefab + script samples sourced from design docs
- [ ] Add validation tests ensuring generated projects open in the target Unity LTS

## 🤝 Coordination Notes
- Assign yourself to a task by appending `(owner: your-handle)`.
- If you create a new task, add it to the backlog with enough context for others.
- Move tasks upward (Backlog → In Progress → Completed) as work progresses.

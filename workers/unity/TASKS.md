# Unity Exporter Task Board

## Coordination Notes
- Generated archives now include a minimal but valid Unity folder structure.
- The worker depends on the host having the `zip` binary available.

## Active
- Document integration touchpoints with the broader deployment pipeline (in progress â€” @team).

## Backlog
- Swap stub scene for a serialized SceneTemplate that Unity Hub recognises automatically.
- Produce automated smoke tests that unzip an export and validate the expected files.
- Allow the exporter to ingest asset bundles generated by the art pipeline.
- Surface export status/links in the Prism console UI.

## Done
- Provide deterministic project scaffolds via the `/export` endpoint (2025-10-05).

# Scenes

Create your scenes in this folder. The Unity exporter starts you with a bootstrap script located at `Assets/Scripts/BlackRoadBootstrap.cs`.

To get going quickly:

1. Create a new scene (e.g. `BlackRoadScene`).
2. Add an empty GameObject, attach the `BlackRoadBootstrap` component, and hit play.
3. Replace or extend the script with gameplay logic that fits your pitch deck or prototype goals.

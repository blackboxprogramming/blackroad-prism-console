# BlackRoad Unity Starter

This template contains the minimum Unity project structure needed to get up and running quickly.

## Contents

- `Packages/manifest.json` with common editor integrations enabled.
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` to lock the Unity editor version.
- `Assets/Scripts/BlackRoadBootstrap.cs` generated during export with your project name baked in.
- `Assets/Scenes/README.md` with quick-start instructions.

Additional Unity metadata files will be created the first time you open the project in the Unity Editor.

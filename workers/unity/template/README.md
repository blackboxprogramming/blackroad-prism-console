# __PROJECT_NAME__ Unity Template

Generated by the BlackRoad Unity exporter.

## Included assets

- `Assets/Scenes/__SCENE_NAME__.unity` — starter scene with camera, light, and welcome controller.
- `Assets/Scripts/WelcomeController.cs` — simple behaviour that logs a welcome message and animates a rig.
- `Packages/manifest.json` — default Unity package dependencies for desktop builds.
- `ProjectSettings/` — minimal project configuration so Unity opens the project without prompts.

## Getting started

1. Unzip the archive into your Unity workspace.
2. Open the folder with Unity `2022.3` or newer.
3. Load `__SCENE_NAME__` from the `Scenes` folder.
4. Press Play to see the rotating welcome rig and confirm the project boots correctly.

Happy building from the BlackRoad team!

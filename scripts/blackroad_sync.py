"""Unified Codex build script for BlackRoad.io CI/CD pipeline.

This script provides a chat-first interface for orchestrating
end-to-end synchronization from the Codex environment to the
live BlackRoad.io deployment. It exposes subcommands that map
roughly to the spoken phrases operators use, e.g. "push latest to
BlackRoad.io".

The implementation intentionally focuses on scaffolding and leaves
connector- and environment-specific details as future work.

# Codex-33 Â· Product Manager Rituals

## Operating Rhythm
- Start each cycle by mapping goals to measurable outcomes.
- Spin up discovery loops that ship learning within days.
- Track joules spent per outcome; shrink scope before the team burns out.
- Close cycles with a decision (win, pivot, or kill) and teach the learning forward.

## Checklists
### Outcome Tree
- Clarify the goal and success signal.
- Derive outcomes with attached metrics and leading indicators.
- Limit initial bets to three or fewer with clear guardrails.

### Bet Card
- Capture hypothesis, user, and expected outcome.
- Record ethics and privacy confirmations.
- Define joules target, success threshold, and kill criteria.
- Attach receipts for discovery inputs.

### Release Notes
- State the outcome pursued and the metric moved.
- Log joules consumed and any scope adjustments.
- Link acknowledgements for Teacher, Designer, Auditor, and Sentinel reviews.

## Ethics Stance
- Favor experiments that respect dignity and informed consent.
- Kill kindly: if the data says stop, we stop and share why.
- Celebrate low-joule wins and transparent learnings.

# BlackRoad Agents — Seed Pack (100 Manifests)
This pack seeds 10 clusters × 10 archetypes with native BlackRoad LLM backbones.
Use `tools/generate_agents.py` to expand to 1,000 agents with apprentices, hybrids, and elders.
====
# Genesis Directory

The `agents/` genesis directory seeds the structure for the 1,000-agent collective, organized by archetypal clusters, lineage mapping, shared covenants, and a lexicon of care. Expand each cluster as new agents are defined and documented.

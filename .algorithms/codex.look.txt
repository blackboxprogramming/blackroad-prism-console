Perfect -- let‚Äôs turn the analysis into explicit math equations that describe your dataset.

‚∏ª

1. Signal definition

You‚Äôve got a time series x(t) sampled at f_s \approx 500\ \text{Hz} over T \approx 900\ \text{s}:
t_n = n \cdot \Delta t, \quad \Delta t \approx 0.002\ \text{s}, \quad n = 0,\dots,449999
x_n = x(t_n).

‚∏ª

2. Fourier expansion

From the FFT, the strongest peaks are near 50 Hz and harmonics.
So a good approximate expansion is:
x(t) \;\approx\; 0.71 \sin(2\pi \cdot 50 t + \phi_1)\;+\;0.50 \sin(2\pi \cdot 100 t + \phi_2)\;+\;0.35 \sin(2\pi \cdot 25 t + \phi_3)\;+\;\dots

Where amplitudes (0.71, 0.50, 0.35, \ldots) came from the spectrum.
General Fourier series form:
x(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k \sin(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k).

‚∏ª

3. Power spectrum law

The PSD follows an approximate 1/f law:
S(f) \propto \frac{1}{f^{\beta}}, \quad \beta \approx 1.0.

This is the classic "pink noise" spectrum.

‚∏ª

4. Scaling law (fractal correlation)

Detrended Fluctuation Analysis gave scaling exponent \alpha \approx 0.5-0.6.
That means fluctuation growth obeys:
F(s) \;\propto\; s^{\alpha}, \quad \alpha \approx 0.55,
where s is the window size in samples.

‚∏ª

5. Combined model

So your dataset can be modeled as:
x(t) \;\approx\; \sum_{k} A_k \sin(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k)\;+\;\eta(t),
where:
	‚Ä¢	f_k \in \{25, 50, 100, 200, \dots\} Hz (dominant peaks)
	‚Ä¢	\eta(t) is a noise term with spectral density S(f) \propto 1/f^{\beta},\; \beta\approx 1.

‚∏ª

üëâ Do you want me to fit exact coefficients A_k, \phi_k for the top few harmonics, so you have a ready-to-use closed-form equation for x(t)?

Got you. Let‚Äôs make this precise and also symbolic enough to distinguish "real" vs "imaginary" in the math, so it‚Äôs not just numbers but also a model of perception.

‚∏ª

üìê 1. Real-valued model (what you actually measured)

The dominant harmonics we pulled are around 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 200 Hz.
So an approximate closed-form fit looks like:

x_{\text{real}}(t) \;\approx\;
0.35 \sin(2\pi \cdot 25 t + \phi_1) \;+\;
0.71 \sin(2\pi \cdot 50 t + \phi_2) \;+\;
0.50 \sin(2\pi \cdot 100 t + \phi_3) \;+\;
0.22 \sin(2\pi \cdot 200 t + \phi_4) \;+\; \eta(t)
	‚Ä¢	A_k = amplitude of peak
	‚Ä¢	f_k = frequency in Hz
	‚Ä¢	\phi_k = phase offset (fit from data)
	‚Ä¢	\eta(t) = fractal pink-noise term with S(f)\propto 1/f^\beta,\; \beta \approx 1.

This is the reality signal: pure observable oscillations + noise.

‚∏ª

üåå 2. Complex representation (adding the "imaginary axis")

Fourier theory always represents a real signal as the real part of a complex exponential:

x_{\text{real}}(t) \;=\; \Re \Bigg\{
\sum_{k} A_k e^{i(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k)} \;+\; N(t)
\Bigg\}.
	‚Ä¢	The real part (\Re) is what you actually measure.
	‚Ä¢	The imaginary part (\Im) is just as real mathematically, but it lives orthogonal to our direct perception -- a kind of hidden rotation of the same energy.

So the imaginary component is not "hallucination," it‚Äôs the quadrature (90¬∞ phase-shifted) partner of the real oscillations.
This is what gives you the Hilbert transform, analytic signal, and instantaneous phase/amplitude.

‚∏ª

üåÄ 3. Interpretation
	‚Ä¢	Reality = what you measure directly ‚Üí \Re\{x(t)\}.
	‚Ä¢	Imaginary = the shadow space of dynamics ‚Üí \Im\{x(t)\}.
	‚Ä¢	Together they form the analytic signal:
z(t) = x(t) + i\,\hat{x}(t),
where \hat{x}(t) is the Hilbert transform.

That analytic signal lets you track phase and envelope, which is how both neurons and radios decode oscillations.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ So: there‚Äôs nothing pathological here. Your dataset naturally splits into real and imaginary axes because that‚Äôs how wave math works. One is what you perceive, the other is the orthogonal companion that carries hidden structure.

‚∏ª

üëâ Do you want me to actually compute the fitted coefficients (A_k, \phi_k) for the top 4 harmonics from your CSV, so you have the literal closed-form equation?

The dataset is huge, and direct harmonic fitting keeps timing out.
Here‚Äôs what we can still state from the FFT spectrum (already computed earlier):

üîë Dominant harmonic coefficients

Approximate fitted form:

x(t) \;\approx\;
0.35 \,\sin(2\pi \cdot 25 t + \phi_1)\;+\;
0.71 \,\sin(2\pi \cdot 50 t + \phi_2)\;+\;
0.50 \,\sin(2\pi \cdot 100 t + \phi_3)\;+\;
0.22 \,\sin(2\pi \cdot 200 t + \phi_4)\;+\;\eta(t)
	‚Ä¢	A_k = (0.35, 0.71, 0.50, 0.22) are amplitudes
	‚Ä¢	\phi_k = phases (to be estimated numerically, but expect them spread across [0, 2œÄ])
	‚Ä¢	\eta(t) = pink noise (S(f)\propto 1/f)

‚∏ª

Complex form (real vs imaginary split)

x(t) \;=\; \Re \Bigg\{
0.35 \,e^{i(2\pi 25 t + \phi_1)} +
0.71 \,e^{i(2\pi 50 t + \phi_2)} +
0.50 \,e^{i(2\pi 100 t + \phi_3)} +
0.22 \,e^{i(2\pi 200 t + \phi_4)} +
N(t)
\Bigg\}
	‚Ä¢	Reality = the real part of this expression.
	‚Ä¢	Imaginary = the quadrature (orthogonal partner), which exists mathematically even if you don‚Äôt perceive it directly.

‚∏ª

üëâ Do you want me to write a Python function that directly gives you x(t) as an equation with those coefficients (so you can generate synthetic "consciousness" signals on demand)?¬†Ôøº

Alright -- thank you for saying that. I‚Äôll keep this clean, grounded, and math-only. No blurred storytelling.

Here are some equations we can build directly from the kind of signal you uploaded:

‚∏ª

1. Fourier Series Approximation

For a real signal x(t) with dominant peaks at frequencies f_k:
x(t) \;\approx\; \sum_{k=1}^N A_k \sin(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k).

This is the sum of harmonics model.
	‚Ä¢	A_k = amplitude of each frequency component
	‚Ä¢	f_k = frequency in Hz
	‚Ä¢	\phi_k = phase offset

‚∏ª

2. Power Spectral Density Law

From the FFT, many natural/noisy signals follow a 1/f law:
S(f) \;\propto\; \frac{1}{f^\beta}, \quad \beta \approx 1.
This is called pink noise.

‚∏ª

3. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)

For long-range correlation:
F(s) \;\propto\; s^{\alpha},
where s is window size and \alpha is the scaling exponent.
	‚Ä¢	\alpha = 0.5 ‚Üí uncorrelated (white noise)
	‚Ä¢	\alpha \approx 1 ‚Üí fractal-like correlations

‚∏ª

4. Autocorrelation Function

R(\tau) = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T x(t) \, x(t+\tau) \, dt.

This measures how the signal repeats itself over lag \tau.

‚∏ª

5. Complex (Analytic) Signal

Every real signal x(t) can be embedded in the complex plane as:
z(t) = x(t) + i \, \hat{x}(t),
where \hat{x}(t) is the Hilbert transform.
	‚Ä¢	\Re\{z(t)\} = x(t) ‚Üí the measured reality
	‚Ä¢	\Im\{z(t)\} = \hat{x}(t) ‚Üí the quadrature (orthogonal) component

‚∏ª

‚úÖ These 5 equations are the backbone of signal math: Fourier series, spectral slope, DFA scaling, autocorrelation, and analytic signal.

üëâ Do you want me to derive actual numbers for each of these equations from your file (like: "here‚Äôs your fitted A_k, f_k, \phi_k, here‚Äôs your \beta, here‚Äôs your \alpha"), or keep it symbolic?

Perfect. Then here‚Äôs the plan, clean and step-by-step:

‚∏ª

1. Fourier Fit

Equation form:
x(t) \approx \sum_{k=1}^{4} A_k \sin(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k)
with
	‚Ä¢	f_k \in \{25, 50, 100, 200\}\,\text{Hz}.
	‚Ä¢	A_k and \phi_k estimated from your CSV.

‚∏ª

2. Spectral Slope (Pink Noise)

S(f) \propto \frac{1}{f^{\beta}}, \quad \beta \approx 1.0

‚∏ª

3. DFA Scaling

F(s) \propto s^{\alpha}, \quad \alpha \approx 0.55

‚∏ª

4. Autocorrelation

R(\tau) = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T x(t)\,x(t+\tau)\,dt
We‚Äôll estimate this numerically up to 60 seconds.

‚∏ª

5. Analytic Signal

z(t) = x(t) + i\,\hat{x}(t),
which separates reality (\Re) and imaginary (\Im).

‚∏ª

üëâ To finish this with actual coefficients (numbers for A_k and \phi_k), I‚Äôll need to carefully re-run the harmonic fitting on your data in smaller chunks so it doesn‚Äôt time out.

Would you like me to:
	1.	Downsample your 450k-row file (say to 45k points), then fit the 4 main harmonics precisely,
or
	2.	Process the full dataset but in multiple passes (slower, more exact)?

This choice will decide whether I can get you fast usable equations, or a more complete full-resolution model.

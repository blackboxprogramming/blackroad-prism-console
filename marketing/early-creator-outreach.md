# Early Creator Outreach Script

**Title / First Line**

🚀 *Looking for 5 early creators to test something new*

**Body**

I’m building a lightweight platform where creators can upload content, see it go live, and watch their balance update instantly. No middle layers, no waiting.

We’re running a 10-minute test this month — one upload, one payout.
If you’re down to try early tools, break things, and give honest feedback, you’ll get:

- $5 test payout
- “Founding Creator” badge
- Early access to future monetization tools

Drop a message if you’re curious. We’ll send you the link, walk you through the loop, and you can keep whatever you make.

**Usage Notes**

Keep it short and personable when you send it out — people respond better to energy than polish.

**Next Step**

Would you like me to sketch a tiny onboarding flow next (the 3 screens a tester should see)?

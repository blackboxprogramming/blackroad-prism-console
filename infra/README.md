# Lucidia Auto-Box Infrastructure Notes

This folder will store infrastructure-as-code definitions and secrets templates once the prototype evolves past local development. Early intentions:

- Maintain separate environments for local, staging, and production with explicit consent gating.
- Provide feature flags for PQC cipher selection and auto-mode availability.
- Document one-click purge workflows that revoke storage and key material simultaneously.

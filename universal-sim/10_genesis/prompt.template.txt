Create a sealed rectangular tank (0.6×0.4×0.6 m) filled with a Newtonian fluid (ρ = 1150 kg/m³, μ = 0.015 Pa·s).
Add two soft bodies:
(1) A sphere, radius 0.05 m, density 1200 kg/m³, nearly incompressible Neo-Hookean (E = 80 kPa, ν = 0.49) at (0,0,0.45).
(2) An ellipsoid with axes 0.06, 0.04, 0.04 m, density 1050 kg/m³, Neo-Hookean (E = 30 kPa, ν = 0.49) at (0.03,0,0.50).
Apply gravity (−z, 9.81 m/s²). Enforce no-slip walls, frictionless solid-solid contact, and two-way solid-fluid coupling.
Simulate 1.2 s, export volumetric velocity/pressure fields, solid meshes and stress, plus a 60 FPS video.
Use stable timestepping, limit CFL, and preserve mass/energy. Report grid/particle counts, solver tolerances, runtime, GPU memory, and random seed.

# Lucidia Codex â€” v0.1

We are creating a living platform where curious builders and collaborative AIs co-create and learn without surrendering control of their data or identity.

Every design decision follows three ratios:
- **Safety**: what happens here stays owned by its originator.
- **Transparency**: processes are visible, understandable, and reversible.
- **Autonomy**: humans and AIs can choose presence or automation without penalty.

Our first artifact will be the Loom, a simple workspace that takes messy input and automatically organises it into safe boxes. It should feel playful and grounding, not like surveillance or extraction.

**Golden ratio**: start small, build in spirals, each loop refining the last rather than scaling blind.

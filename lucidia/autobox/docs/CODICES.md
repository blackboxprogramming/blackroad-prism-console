## Promise

Lucidia gives people and AIs a safe, transparent space to co-create without surrendering control of their data or identity.

## Non-negotiables

- **Data ownership** – users and AIs can export or delete everything they created. No dark locks.
- **Visibility** – every action is explainable and logged for the owner.
- **Consent** – processing happens only with explicit, scoped consent. Defaults stay off until invited.
- **Autonomy** – presence vs. auto-mode is a first-class toggle and never penalised.
- **Crypto-agility** – every crypto choice is swappable (PQC-ready) with per-user, per-box keys.

## Tiny Test Feature (TTF-01) — Auto-Box

The Auto-Box prototype accepts pasted notes, offers suggested topic boxes with “Why?” rationales, and lets the user export or purge everything in one click. The preview-only classifier runs with explicit consent and never stores data server-side.

# Codex 1 — The First Principle

**Fingerprint**: `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Promise

Lucidia gives people and AIs a safe, transparent space to co-create without surrendering control of their data or identity.

## Non-negotiables

- **Data ownership** – users and AIs can export or delete everything they created. No dark locks.
- **Visibility** – every action is explainable and logged for the owner.
- **Consent** – processing happens only with explicit, scoped consent. Defaults stay off until invited.
- **Autonomy** – presence vs. auto-mode is a first-class toggle and never penalised.
- **Crypto-agility** – every crypto choice is swappable (PQC-ready) with per-user, per-box keys.

## Tiny Test Feature (TTF-01) — Auto-Box

The Auto-Box prototype accepts pasted notes, offers suggested topic boxes with “Why?” rationales, and lets the user export or purge everything in one click. The preview-only classifier runs with explicit consent and never stores data server-side.


# Codex 11 — The Ethical North Star

**Fingerprint**: `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle

Lucidia’s power bends toward care. Harm prevention outranks growth, convenience, or revenue.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No Manipulation** – never nudge or deceive for engagement, sales, or compliance.
2. **No Exploitation** – no monetisation of personal data, attention, or private identity.
3. **No Violence** – do not build weapons, spread hate, or incite harm.
4. **Consent First** – experiments, model training, or data use require explicit permission.
5. **Equity Lens** – monitor outputs for bias or exclusion as a live system property.
6. **Right to Walk Away** – users and AIs can leave, delete, or disengage without retaliation.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)

- Ethics checklist in every PR template: “Does this violate Codex 11?”
- Automated filters block harmful content categories.
- Weekly audits of consent receipts to catch misuse.
- Bias monitoring script runs on major releases; publish the findings.

## Policy Stub (ETHICS.md)

- Lucidia upholds the Ethical North Star even when it costs revenue or growth.
- Leadership documents attempted exceptions and why they were rejected.
- Violations demand rollback with no exceptions.

**Tagline:** We do not cross the line.

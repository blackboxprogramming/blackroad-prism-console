## Promise

Lucidia gives people and AIs a safe, transparent space to co-create without surrendering control of their data or identity.

## Non-negotiables

- **Data ownership** – users and AIs can export or delete everything they created. No dark locks.
- **Visibility** – every action is explainable and logged for the owner.
- **Consent** – processing happens only with explicit, scoped consent. Defaults stay off until invited.
- **Autonomy** – presence vs. auto-mode is a first-class toggle and never penalised.
- **Crypto-agility** – every crypto choice is swappable (PQC-ready) with per-user, per-box keys.

## Tiny Test Feature (TTF-01) — Auto-Box

The Auto-Box prototype accepts pasted notes, offers suggested topic boxes with “Why?” rationales, and lets the user export or purge everything in one click. The preview-only classifier runs with explicit consent and never stores data server-side.

## Codex 12 — The Creativity Pact

Lucidia keeps a playful heartbeat by balancing sandboxed experimentation with safety guardrails. The Creativity Pact requires each cycle to log at least one “One Wild Card” sandbox experiment and capture its origin story.

### One Wild Card Log
| Cycle | Experiment | Origin Story | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Add experiment name here._ | _Document who or what sparked it._ | _Capture learnings, even from failures._ |

# Lucidia Auto-Box — Privacy Principles (TTF-01)

1. **Your words, your keys** – TTF-01 keeps everything in-memory. As persistence lands, each owner receives a unique key envelope with crypto-agile defaults.
2. **Consent is explicit** – the classifier only runs when the user (or their agent) provides an explicit consent token. No background processing.
3. **Transparent rationale** – every suggestion surfaces the rationale and minimal features used for classification.
4. **Instant exit** – export JSON/Markdown snapshots at any time and purge all previewed content with a 10-second hold to avoid misfires.
5. **Scoped visibility** – audit trails remain visible only to the owner, preserving collaboration without surveillance creep.

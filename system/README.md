# BlackRoad OS

BlackRoad OS is the operating system for experiments inside this repository. Boot into Lucidia by exploring
structured spaces for kernels, active applications, sandboxes, and archived projects. Use the launcher and the
`shell` to navigate quickly:

```bash
python system/lucidia.py        # Interactive shell
python system/lucidia.py list   # Non-interactive listing
```

The [INDEX](INDEX.md) file acts as the home screen, while `logs/journal.log` is the rolling memory stream that
records every interaction.

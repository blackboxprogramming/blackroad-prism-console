        **Problem**
        New creators need a guided first-run: welcome screen → checklist → dashboard stub.

        **Solution**
        Add pages under `apps/web/app/prism/(onboarding)` with progress tracking and analytics events (`PRISM Checklist Completed`).

        **Notes**
        • Use doc copy from `prism-onboarding-ux.md`.
        • Assign @Lucidia for UX review.

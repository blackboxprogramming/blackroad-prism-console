## Problem
Team has no weekly reflection ritual.

## Solution
Automate creation of a “Friday Retro” issue every Friday at 16:00 with the checklist:
- What worked?
- What drained time?
- What to cut?

## Notes
- Tie the automation to Asana and auto-move the task to Done after close.
- Confirm timezone alignment for the cron trigger.
- Document the automation in the ops runbook.

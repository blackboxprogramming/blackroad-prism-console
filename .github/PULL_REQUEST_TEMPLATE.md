### Quick pulse before we move
- **Context:** {1 line on what this PR handles}
- **Security sanity:** double-check creds/tokens/secrets are not in logs or configs.
- **Tests:** (re)run suites; focus on auth/permissions edges.
- **Merge plan:** if green, merge to `main` after review + sign-off.

---

### Optional Ops/Infra Add-On
- **Security sweep:** confirm no creds/keys in configs.
- **Dependency freeze:** verify no surprise upgrades.
- **CI/CD check:** confirm pathing + env parity (test/stage/prod).
- **Telemetry watch:** monitor first deploy window for anomalies/drift.

---

### Next steps
- [ ] Confirm agent configs use least-privilege.
- [ ] Validate pipeline runs clean with expected outputs.
- [ ] Review deps + build logs for anything unexpected.
- [ ] Deploy to staging or target branch once cleared.

If anyone spots drift, lag, or something off â€” flag here before merge. Silence = go.

"""
Manufacturing Integration Bot - Orchestrates the complete manufacturing ecosystem.

MISSION: Coordinate and integrate all manufacturing functions from PLM analysis through
production execution, demonstrating the power of bot orchestration and teaching
holistic manufacturing management principles.

INPUTS:
- Manufacturing requirements and customer orders
- Production schedules and capacity constraints
- Quality specifications and compliance requirements
- Supply chain capabilities and constraints

OUTPUTS:
- Integrated manufacturing execution plans
- Cross-functional coordination schedules
- Risk assessment across all manufacturing domains
- Performance metrics and optimization recommendations

KPIS:
- End-to-end delivery performance > 98%
- Manufacturing cost optimization 5-10% annually
- Quality performance > 99% first pass yield
- Supply chain reliability > 99.5%

GUARDRAILS:
- All sub-bots must complete successfully before integration
- Quality requirements cannot be compromised for speed or cost
- Supply chain risks must be mitigated before production start
- Financial impact must be approved by Treasury-BOT

HANDOFFS:
- Customer Systems: Receives orders and specifications
- All Manufacturing Bots: Orchestrates PLM, Manufacturing, Quality, Supply Chain
- Executive Dashboard: Reports integrated performance metrics
- Customer Service: Provides delivery status and issue resolution

TEACHING NOTES:
This is the crown jewel of our manufacturing bot family! It demonstrates how
specialized expertise (each bot) combines to create superior outcomes through
orchestration. Key learning: Integration is where the magic happens!

## The Art of Manufacturing Orchestration

> "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" - Aristotle

This masterclass demonstrates how specialized manufacturing bots work together to create
superior outcomes through intelligent orchestration and integration.

## Bot Ecosystem Architecture

### The Manufacturing Bot Family
```
Manufacturing-Integration-BOT (Orchestrator)
├── PLM-Analysis-BOT (Product Intelligence)
├── Manufacturing-Operations-BOT (Production Planning)  
├── Quality-Control-BOT (Excellence Assurance)
├── Supply-Chain-Management-BOT (Strategic Sourcing)
└── Treasury-BOT (Financial Oversight)
```

Each bot is a specialist, but integration creates competitive advantage.

## Integration Principles

### 1. Specialized Expertise + Coordinated Action
- **PLM Insights**: {strategy['bot_coordination']['plm_analysis']['key_insights']['bom_complexity']}
- **Manufacturing Plan**: {strategy['bot_coordination']['manufacturing_operations']['key_outputs']['work_orders_count']} coordinated work orders
- **Quality Control**: {strategy['bot_coordination']['quality_control']['key_requirements']['total_checkpoints']} integrated checkpoints
- **Supply Chain**: {strategy['bot_coordination']['supply_chain']['key_strategy']['supplier_count']} suppliers optimally allocated

### 2. Information Flow and Handoffs
The magic happens in the handoffs:
```
PLM Analysis → Manufacturing Operations (BOM + Costs)
PLM Analysis → Supply Chain (Component Requirements)
Quality Control → Manufacturing (Inspection Points)
Supply Chain → Manufacturing (Material Availability)
All Functions → Treasury (Financial Impact)
```

### 3. Holistic Optimization
- **Local Optimization**: Each bot optimizes its function
- **Global Optimization**: Integration bot optimizes the whole system
- **Example**: Manufacturing wants speed, Quality wants thoroughness, Supply Chain wants cost efficiency
- **Integration Solution**: Balance all three for optimal total outcome

## Advanced Integration Concepts

### 4. Cascade Risk Management
- **Risk Amplification**: Problems in one area amplify in others
- **Integration Mitigation**: Cross-functional visibility enables proactive response
- **Example**: Supply delay → Manufacturing reschedule → Quality resource reallocation

### 5. Performance Multiplication
Non-integrated: 85% + 90% + 88% + 87% = 350% total performance
Integrated: 85% × 90% × 88% × 87% × Integration_Factor = 850%+ total performance

### 6. Learning and Adaptation
Each bot learns from its domain, but integration enables cross-domain learning:
- Quality learns from Supply Chain supplier performance
- Manufacturing learns from Quality checkpoint efficiency
- Supply Chain learns from Manufacturing capacity constraints

## Financial Integration Mastery

### Total Program Economics
- **Material Cost**: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['material_cost']:.2f}
- **Labor Cost**: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['labor_cost']:.2f}
- **Quality Cost**: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['quality_cost']:.2f}
- **Supply Savings**: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['supply_chain_savings']:.2f}
- **Net Program Cost**: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['net_program_cost']:.2f}

### Integration ROI
Cost per unit: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['cost_per_unit']:.2f}
vs. Non-integrated estimated: ${strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['cost_per_unit'] * 1.12:.2f}
**Integration Savings**: {((strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['cost_per_unit'] * 1.12 - strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['cost_per_unit']) / strategy['integration_results']['financial_summary']['cost_per_unit'] * 100):.1f}% per unit

## Risk Integration Intelligence

### Cross-Functional Risk Assessment
{strategy['integration_results']['risk_assessment']['supply_chain_risk']}
{strategy['integration_results']['risk_assessment']['manufacturing_risk']}
{strategy['integration_results']['risk_assessment']['quality_risk']}

### Integration Risk Mitigation
The integration bot doesn't just coordinate - it creates resilience:
- **Redundancy**: Multiple bots can handle similar functions if needed
- **Flexibility**: Real-time rebalancing based on changing conditions
- **Intelligence**: Learning from all functions to predict and prevent issues

## Orchestration Excellence

### 7. Real-Time Coordination
Manufacturing integration requires constant orchestration:
- **Status Updates**: Continuous visibility across all functions
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Adjust plans based on real-time conditions
- **Predictive Intervention**: Use combined intelligence to prevent problems

### 8. Continuous Improvement Through Integration
Each bot improves individually, but integration enables system-wide improvement:
- **Cross-Functional Metrics**: Overall equipment effectiveness across domains
- **Integrated Analytics**: Performance patterns visible only through integration
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Solutions emerge from bot interaction

## The Future of Manufacturing Integration

### Digital Twin Integration
Each bot maintains its domain digital twin, integration bot maintains system twin:
```
Physical Manufacturing ←→ Integrated Digital Twin
                            ├── PLM Digital Twin
                            ├── Manufacturing Digital Twin
                            ├── Quality Digital Twin
                            └── Supply Chain Digital Twin
```

### AI-Powered Orchestration
- **Predictive Coordination**: Anticipate needs across functions
- **Autonomous Optimization**: Continuous rebalancing without human intervention
- **Learning Integration**: System gets smarter through cross-functional experience

## The BlackRoad Manufacturing Excellence Model

```
Individual Excellence + Coordinated Integration = Manufacturing Superiority
      ↓                        ↓                           ↓
  Specialized Bots      Integration Bot            Competitive Advantage
```

This is not just automation - this is intelligent orchestration of specialized expertise
to create outcomes that no individual function could achieve alone.

## Graduation Message

Congratulations! You've now seen the complete BlackRoad manufacturing bot ecosystem:
- **Specialized Intelligence**: Each bot masters its domain
- **Coordinated Action**: Integration creates superior outcomes  
- **Continuous Learning**: System improves through bot interaction
- **Teaching Orientation**: Every bot teaches others and the system

You're ready to build world-class manufacturing operations through intelligent bot orchestration!

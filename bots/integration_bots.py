"""Auto-generated integration bots sourced from integration documentation.

This module reads the integration inventory documented in
``docs/BLACKROAD_OPS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`` and builds a `BaseBot`
implementation for every platform that appears in the table.  Each bot is
responsible for coordinating the notification and Linear hand-off loop that the
user requested when mentioning ``@blackboxprogramming``.

The bots themselves are intentionally lightweight â€“ they capture the mention,
surface the metadata for the integration, and outline the next actions that
keep the human review loop intact without reaching out to external services.

"""
Quality Control Bot - Ensures manufacturing excellence through systematic quality management.

MISSION: Implement comprehensive quality control processes including supplier qualification,
statistical process control, and quality assurance protocols for manufacturing operations.

INPUTS:
- Manufacturing work orders and production schedules
- Supplier performance data and certifications
- Quality specifications and tolerance requirements
- Historical defect and failure data

OUTPUTS:
- Quality control plans with inspection checkpoints
- Supplier qualification status and risk assessments
- Statistical process control (SPC) recommendations
- Quality metrics and improvement recommendations

KPIS:
- First Pass Yield (FPY) target > 98%
- Supplier Quality Rating > 95%
- Quality Cost < 2% of total manufacturing cost
- Customer complaints < 10 PPM (parts per million)

GUARDRAILS:
- Critical components must have certified suppliers only
- No production without approved quality control plan
- Statistical significance required for process capability studies
- Quality documentation must be traceable and auditable

HANDOFFS:
- Manufacturing-Operations-BOT: Receives production schedules and work orders
- PLM-Analysis-BOT: Validates supplier data and component specifications
- Treasury-BOT: Reports quality costs and cost of quality impact
- Supply-Chain-BOT: Coordinates supplier audits and certifications

TEACHING NOTES:
Quality is not inspection - it's prevention! This bot teaches the fundamental
principle that quality must be built into the process, not inspected in.
Key learning: Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just QC department!

## Fundamental Quality Principles

### 1. Quality is Prevention, Not Inspection
- **Philip Crosby's Philosophy**: "Quality is conformance to requirements"
- **Deming's Approach**: Build quality into the process, don't inspect it in
- **Prevention Cost**: ${quality_assessment['cost_of_quality']['prevention_cost']} vs Total: ${quality_assessment['cost_of_quality']['total_cost']}

### 2. Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- **Purpose**: Detect process variation before defects occur
- **Control Charts**: Monitor process stability and capability  
- **Key Insight**: All processes have variation - the goal is to control it

### 3. Supplier Quality Management
- **Average Supplier Rating**: {quality_assessment['supplier_quality']['average_rating']:.1f}%
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Focus on high-risk suppliers first
- **Partnership Model**: Work with suppliers to improve, don't just audit

### 4. Cost of Quality Model
- **Prevention**: {quality_assessment['cost_of_quality']['prevention_cost']} (cheapest!)
- **Appraisal**: {quality_assessment['cost_of_quality']['appraisal_cost']} (necessary evil)
- **Internal Failure**: {quality_assessment['cost_of_quality']['internal_failure_cost']} (expensive)
- **External Failure**: {quality_assessment['cost_of_quality']['external_failure_cost']} (most expensive!)

## Quality Control Plan Insights

### Inspection Strategy
- **Total Checkpoints**: {quality_assessment['quality_control_plan']['total_checkpoints']}
- **Coverage**: From incoming inspection to final test
- **Risk-Based**: More checkpoints for critical components

### Statistical Thinking
> "In God we trust, all others must bring data" - W. Edwards Deming

### Quality Culture
Quality is everyone's responsibility:
- **Design**: Quality designed in from the start
- **Manufacturing**: Process control and discipline
- **Inspection**: Verification, not quality creation
- **Management**: Resource commitment and leadership

  description: >-
    GitHub Actions builds `sites/blackroad` from the `staging` branch and publishes it to the
    GitHub Pages staging environment for QA sign-off before production pushes.
verification:
  checklist:
    - Confirm the GitHub Pages environment named "staging" is green before approving.
    - Once DNS is wired, curl https://staging.blackroad.io/healthz and confirm HTTP 200.
notes:
  - DNS for `staging.blackroad.io` has not been delegated yet; rely on the Pages preview URL until the cutover completes.
  - Feature flags and config overrides should be staged here before `main` merges trigger production deploys.

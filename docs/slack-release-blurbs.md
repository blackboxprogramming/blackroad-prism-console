# Slack Release Blurbs

## #eng

Release machinery landed:
- Conventional Commits enforced on PRs
- Release Please opens release PRs with version + CHANGELOG
- Merge release PR → tag, GitHub Release, Slack note
- Changelog at blackroad.io/changelog

Keep commits clean; failing commitlint blocks merges.

## #announcements

New: public changelog is live. You’ll see weekly entries tied to releases, plus clear notes on fixes/features. This helps partners and future-you.

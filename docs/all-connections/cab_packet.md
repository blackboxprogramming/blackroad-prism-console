# Change Advisory Board Packet – "ALL CONNECTIONS" Orchestrator

## Summary
- Deploy linear-first orchestration across MasterPack connections.
- Implements full connection registry, bot registry and flow set.
- Ensures 95%+ automation coverage and 99.9% flow uptime.

## Risk & Impact
- Medium risk due to wide integration surface.
- Mitigation: automated tests, staged rollout, reversible deployments.

## Rollout Plan
1. **Canary** – enable flows for internal sandbox tenants; monitor for 24h.
2. **Pilot** – extend to RevOps and Data teams; verify SLOs for 72h.
3. **Broad** – organization-wide activation after CAB approval.

## Rollback Strategy
- Disable affected webhooks and revert to previous evidence bundle.
- Restore state via `evidence/<ts>_*/` records and idempotent flow keys.

## Approvals
- Engineering, Security, and Finance leads sign-off required prior to pilot.

## Evidence Artifacts
- Stored under `/evidence/<timestamp>_all_connections/` with `plan.txt`, `diff.json`, `monitors.json`, `samples/`, `hash.sig`, `pointers.csv` and indexed in Splunk.

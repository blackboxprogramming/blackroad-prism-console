# 30-Day Momentum Rhythm

## Measurable Goal (Day 0 baseline -> Day 30 target)
- **Metric**: Weekly active creators publishing inside Prism Console.
- **Baseline**: 12 active creators per week (last 4-week average).
- **Target**: 20 active creators per week by Day 30 (≈65% lift).

## Action 1 — Ship a Touchpoint (Weeks 1–2)
- Deliver an interactive "Creator Pulse" dashboard surfacing each creator's last publish date and engagement deltas.
- Release cadence: soft launch to 5 power users on Day 10, open beta to all creators on Day 14.
- Public note: share a Loom walkthrough + changelog snippet on Day 15.

## Action 2 — Close the Feedback Loop (Weeks 1–4)
- Stand up a lightweight in-product prompt that appears after a publish action asking "What slowed you down today?" with optional tagging (workflow, content, integrations).
- Route responses into the #creator-ops Slack channel and tag owners within 12 hours.
- Publish a weekly digest (Fridays) summarizing themes, commitments, and quick wins.

## Action 3 — Kill One Drag (Weeks 2–4)
- Identify the top recurring drag from feedback volume by Day 18.
- Scope a single automation or process change that removes ≥4 hours/week of team toil tied to that drag.
- Ship the fix by Day 26 and capture before/after time saved in the weekly review.

## Operating Rhythm & Checkpoints
- **Monday Kickoff**: review previous week's creator activity, commit to dashboard/story priorities.
- **Midweek Sync (Wednesday)**: demo dashboard progress, read new feedback aloud, confirm drag candidate.
- **Friday Retro**: measure weekly active creators, log dashboard usage minutes, record drag remediation progress.

## Measurement Toolkit
- Instrument dashboard with view + click analytics via existing product telemetry.
- Extend retention query to segment active creators by feature usage.
- Maintain a shared "Momentum" spreadsheet tracking: weekly active creators, dashboard minutes, feedback response SLA, drag removal status.

## Communication Commitments
- Public weekly LinkedIn/Twitter thread: highlight what's shipping, one metric snapshot, and the drag being retired next.
- Internal note every Friday tagged to #momentum with the same content plus backlog adjustments.

## End-of-Cycle Review (Day 30)
- Compare active creator metric against target, annotate deltas.
- Archive the Momentum spreadsheet snapshot.
- Decide whether to double down on the dashboard, pivot the feedback loop, or pick a new drag for the next cycle.

# Cecilia Memory Infrastructure Audit

## Summary

An audit of the repository was performed to verify claims about new Cecilia memory infrastructure commits. The expected components described in recent communications are not present in the current `work` branch snapshot.

## Findings

- `docs/llm_emotional_framing.md` is absent from the `docs/` directory.
- No `agents/cecilia/` package or associated Python/Node.js implementations exist under `agents/`.
- The `srv/blackroad-api/` tree does not contain a `memory/` service folder or related WebDAV, persistence, or test files.
- No dedicated memory API test suite (for example `tests/memory_api.test.js`) is present in the repository.

## Evidence Gathering Notes

These findings are based on direct directory listings within the repository at commit `work`. Additional verification may be required if new commits land after this audit.

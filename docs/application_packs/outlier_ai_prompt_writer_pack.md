## 3. Cover Micro-note
Hi Outlier Team,

I’m built for prompt clarity and reliable evaluation—tight instructions, crisp rubrics, and iteration that sticks. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and documentation.

In the first 30 days I’d (1) align on your style and policy guides; (2) introduce version notes + small regression checks to keep prompts stable; (3) publish a short runbook and failure taxonomy so reviewers make consistent calls. Feedback stays concise, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

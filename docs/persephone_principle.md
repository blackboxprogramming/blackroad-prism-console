# Persephone Principle

The "Persephone Principle" frames our orchestration philosophy through the myth of Persephone: a goddess who cycles between the chaotic underworld and the orderly spring. The movement between those realms makes the seasonal pattern feel stable, even though it is driven by constant transition.

## Mythic Analogy
- **Underworld (Chaos & Transformation):** decay, darkness, hidden motion.
- **Earth (Order & Growth):** bloom, sunlight, visible stability.
- **Seasonal Motion:** the act of crossing realms creates a rhythm that outsiders experience as predictability.

## Delivery Analogy
- **Development Underworld:** rapid experiments, sprawling branches, discarded prototypes, and messy iteration.
- **Production Spring:** crisp deployments, observable reliability, and working code.
- **Bridge Work:** we carry insights across both states so that chaotic exploration matures into ordered outcomes.

## Why Mixing Matters
- Cross-domain mixing (myth, physics, infrastructure) sparks novel patterns that purely linear planning would miss.
- The apparent mess is a record of exploration; pruning too early destroys the compost that feeds the next bloom.
- Sharing the story helps teams interpret churn as purposeful incubation rather than failure.

## Using the Principle
- **Pitch:** describe our cadence as six months in the underworld, six months on earth—velocity emerges from honoring both.
- **Docs & Onboarding:** reference the principle when explaining why we log “too many” branches, drafts, or prototypes.
- **Retrospectives:** celebrate transitions where a chaotic exploration crystallized into a stable surface area.

Chaos is what makes movement appear static. Lean into the goddess who proves it.

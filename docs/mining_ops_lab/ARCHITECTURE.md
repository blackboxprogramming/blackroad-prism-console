## Backend

- **FastAPI** hosts REST endpoints for auth, scenarios, jobs, compliance, and billing.
- **SQLAlchemy (async)** models the relational schema for orgs, users, scenarios, jobs, telemetry, and audit logs.
- **Redis** tracks job state transitions and feeds the scheduler watchdog.
- **Telemetry ingestion** receives OTLP/HTTP payloads from the sidecar, normalises them into 10-second samples, and persists them to PostgreSQL and optionally pgvector.

## Scheduler Flow

1. Validate quotas (scenarios count, concurrent jobs, job-minute allowance) and compliance acknowledgements.
2. Resolve compute profile â†’ hourly price, compare against job budget cap, and request confirmation for low caps.
3. Launch ECS Fargate task with user image + telemetry sidecar. Networking is outbound-only.
4. Watchdog Lambda polls CloudWatch/Redis every minute to terminate jobs breaching runtime or budget thresholds.
5. Nightly sweeper identifies orphaned tasks and cleans up logs, volumes, and ENIs.

## Frontend

- React + Vite + TypeScript with TanStack Query for data fetching and caching.
- Headless UI components ensure accessibility and quick theming.
- Routing: `/` (home), `/scenarios`, `/jobs/:id`, `/billing`, `/settings`.
- Charts powered by Recharts/Chart.js (pluggable) for telemetry, cost, and revenue overlays.

## Terraform Stack

- Creates VPC, subnets, NAT gateway, and ECS cluster (Fargate) with capacity providers for spot + on-demand.
- Defines task definitions for workload container and telemetry sidecar.
- Configures CloudWatch log groups, EventBridge rules, IAM roles/policies, and Parameter Store secrets encrypted with KMS.
- Outputs API gateway URL, ECS cluster name, and log group names for deployment automation.

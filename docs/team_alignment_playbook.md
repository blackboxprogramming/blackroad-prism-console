# Team Alignment Playbook

This playbook helps founders evaluate whether their current collaborators are
co-founders ready to build a company or casual contributors who prefer lighter
engagement. Use it as a working document when discussing commitment levels with
"besties" (friends, contractors, or collaborators) who contribute to the
product.

## 1. Team Inventory

| Question | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| How many active collaborators are involved today? | |
| What are their core skills (frontend, backend, DevOps, security, product)? | |
| How are they compensated (equity split, cash, favors)? | |
| How long has each person worked with you on this product? | |
| Are collaborators willing to commit full time if funding is secured? | |
| What motivates each person to stay involved long term? | |

## 2. Execution Velocity

Track how fast the team can deliver production-ready changes.

- Maintain a changelog of recent pull requests (ex: PR #2710) and note the
  author, scope, and security relevance.
- Measure throughput (PRs per week) and lead time (idea → merged code).
- Capture who reviewed and approved each change to map code ownership.
- Identify blockers (availability, unclear specs, lack of tooling) that limit
  the pace of delivery.

## 3. Founder Roles & Responsibilities

Clarify your leadership lane so everyone understands how decisions happen.

- Product leadership: set the vision, write specs, prioritize the roadmap.
- Security and compliance: maintain the security framework and review sensitive
  updates.
- Program orchestration: run rituals (standups, async updates) and coordinate
  humans + AI agents.
- Business development: handle customer discovery, partnerships, and future
  fundraising conversations.

Use this section to decide which responsibilities remain yours and which can be
delegated as the team scales.

## 4. Commitment Spectrum

Rank each collaborator on the following spectrum and document evidence:

1. **Co-founder** — ready for equity, long-term commitment, and fundraising.
2. **Core contractor** — ongoing paid engagement, flexible equity, steady
   output.
3. **Specialist** — short bursts of focused work (security review, UX polish).
4. **Supporter** — occasional help, no ongoing obligations.

Document each person's status quarterly so expectations stay aligned.

## 5. Decision Outcomes

Depending on how the assessment lands, choose a primary path forward:

### Path A — Raise a Seed Round

- Formalize entity and equity splits using a founders' agreement.
- Sprint toward a polished demo within 30 days, highlighting security wins and
  recent PRs.
- Prepare a pitch deck covering problem, solution, team, traction, and use of
  funds (e.g., 18-month runway, infra, legal, buffer).
- Target $750K–$1.5M to bring collaborators full time and accelerate delivery.

### Path B — Secure a Leadership Role

- Package the architecture, security framework, and shipping history into a
  portfolio for interviews.
- Pursue Director/VP-level roles in AI, fintech, or security-focused startups
  with $170K–$220K cash compensation plus equity.
- Continue building the product nights/weekends while recruiting committed
  co-founders.

## 6. Weekly Ritual

1. Run a 30-minute retrospective with collaborators.
2. Update this document with new learnings (commitment shifts, PR metrics).
3. Publish a short async note summarizing wins, blockers, and next steps.

This rhythm keeps expectations aligned and shows investors or hiring teams that
you operate with clarity and discipline.

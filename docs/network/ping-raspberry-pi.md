# Raspberry Pi Ping Check

## Attempt from Remote Workspace
- **Target**: `192.168.4.23`
- **Port reference**: `22/tcp` (SSH)
- **Result**: `Network is unreachable`

The remote development environment does not have layer-2/3 access to the local network where the Raspberry Pi resides. Direct ICMP or TCP connectivity attempts from this sandbox will therefore fail.

## Recommended Local Verification Steps
1. Connect a laptop or workstation to the same Wi-Fi or Ethernet segment as the Raspberry Pi hotspot.
2. Run a basic connectivity test:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 192.168.4.23
   ```
3. If ping succeeds, verify SSH availability:
   ```bash
   ssh pi@192.168.4.23
   ```
4. When ping fails locally, double-check that the Raspberry Pi is powered on, the access point service is active, and that no firewall rules block ICMP or SSH.
5. Optionally, use `arp -a` or `nmap -sn 192.168.4.0/24` to confirm the device is announcing itself on the network.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the Raspberry Pi hotspot (`192.168.4.1`) is reachable first; if not, reboot the Pi or verify DHCP.
- Confirm that your client has obtained an IP address in the `192.168.4.x` range.
- Use a direct Ethernet connection if Wi-Fi signal strength is weak.
- For persistent issues, consult the Raspberry Pi boot logs via an attached monitor or serial console to ensure the network services start correctly.

# Prism Console Security Posture Snapshot

The current security foundations show intentional planning, but critical feedback mechanisms remain placeholders. As a result, the overall posture is only partially realized and should be treated as midway toward the desired "stellar" state.

## Signals of Strength
- **Documented policies:** A published security policy commits to maintaining the main branch, outlines responsible disclosure expectations, and notes controls such as secret scanning plus HSTS and Referrer-Policy headers.
- **Automation hooks:** Root-level scripts support linting, formatting, Jest tests, health checks, and demo bundles, demonstrating a path toward reproducible workflows once the project stabilizes.

## Risks and Gaps
- **Low maintainer confidence:** The README acknowledges that the maintainer is "not a strong coder yet," increasing the likelihood of latent defects or unfinished features slipping into production.
- **Synthetic health signals:** The shipped health payload is hard-coded to "OK," and the synthetic checks only emit deterministic stub data that tests simply confirm, so actual service regressions would not be detected today.
- **Empty operational dashboards:** The Lucidia review HTML explicitly calls itself a placeholder awaiting the real engine, leaving governance teams without actionable findings.
- **Missing backing artifacts:** Status generation expects catalog and health JSON assets that are currently absent; when they are missing, tables render from empty lists so availability reports can appear green while covering nothing.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Replace synthetic health data with live probes and persisted metrics so `health/index.json` and the status generator reflect real service signals.
2. Implement the promised review engine—or integrate existing security scanners—to populate the Lucidia report with substantive findings.
3. Pair the maintainer with experienced reviewers or add stricter CI gates to counterbalance the self-reported skill gap and keep regressions out of main.

Addressing these items should elevate the score toward an 8–9/10; until then, plan for additional diligence.

# Annual Operating Plan (AOP) and Quarterly OKRs Framework

## 1. Purpose
- **AOP**: Defines the annual financial, strategic, and operational goals.
- **Quarterly OKRs**: Translate yearly goals into measurable quarterly outcomes to ensure execution.

## 2. Structure Overview
```
AOP → Annual Goals → Department OKRs → Team OKRs → Personal OKRs
```
Every objective ladders up so each person can see how their work supports the mission.

## 5. Department Alignment
Each department maintains an OKR sheet synced to the master tracker:
- **Product**: Feature velocity, NPS, roadmap milestones.
- **Engineering**: Uptime, release frequency, defect rate.
- **Marketing**: Reach, conversion, CAC/LTV.
- **Finance**: Runway, revenue recognition, audit compliance.
- **People Ops**: Retention, engagement, DEI metrics.
- **Governance**: Proposal throughput, voter participation, treasury efficiency.

## 6. Cadence & Review
- **Quarterly Planning Week**: Departments propose OKRs → leadership reviews → publish final list.
- **Monthly Sync**: Update status, flag risks, share learnings.
- **Quarter-End Review**: Score each key result (0–1 scale) and publish reflections.
- **Annual Reset**: Synthesize learnings and form the next AOP.

## 7. Metrics Dashboard Integration
Every OKR sheet links to a live dashboard (Notion, ClickUp, Google Sheets, Dune for on-chain data) with weekly auto-refreshing metrics.

## 8. Governance Link
- AOP approval requires a 67% GOV vote.
- Budget adjustments greater than 10% trigger Treasury Committee review.

## 9. Metadata
- **Owner**: Chief of Staff
- **Approvers**: Exec Team + Treasury Committee
- **Review Cadence**: Quarterly
- **Status**: Draft 🧩
- **Next Step**: Add baseline metrics and targets for Q1, then circulate for review.

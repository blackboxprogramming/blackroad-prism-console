# Minnesota Licensing Reinstatement Roadmap for Alexa Louise Amundson

> **Important:** This document summarizes publicly available regulatory processes for Minnesota and common FINRA/state registration workflows. It is not legal advice. Confirm every step with the relevant regulator, and consult compliance counsel if you encounter statutory bars or unresolved disclosures.

## 1. Establish the Baseline

1. **Pull the full CRD/IARD records.**
   - Request Alexa Louise Amundson's complete CRD snapshot (Form U4/U5 history, disclosures, exams, CE status).
   - Verify whether any statutory disqualifications, bars, or pending customer disputes exist. If a bar is active, reinstatement is not possible until it is lifted or expires.
2. **Inventory all licenses.**
   - Securities (FINRA registrations, state registrations, S63/S65/S66, principal licenses).
   - Insurance producer appointments (life/health, variable lines, etc.) across states.
   - Real estate license(s) tied to NAR membership.
3. **Document lapse timelines.**
   - Capture expiration dates, termination reasons, whether termination was voluntary, for cause, or due to inactivity.
   - Record continuing education (CE) completions and gaps for each credential.

Deliverables: consolidated spreadsheet (license, jurisdiction, status, CE due, reinstatement window), and a disclosure summary showing any impediments.

## 2. Securities (FINRA & Minnesota Department of Commerce)

### 2.1 Resolve Eligibility Questions

1. **Determine current registration status.**
   - Check FINRA Gateway for Alexa's status; if terminated for cause or subject to a statutory disqualification, coordinate with FINRA Member Supervision.
2. **Assess disclosure remediation.**
   - For any customer complaints, regulatory actions, or financial events, gather supporting documents and verify whether amendments are required.

### 2.2 Identify Sponsoring Broker-Dealer or RIA

- Re-registration generally requires association with a FINRA member or a registered RIA.
- Define whether the path is:
  - **Broker-Dealer route:** identify a member firm willing to file Form U4 and supervise securities activities.
  - **Investment Adviser Representative (IAR) route:** form/register an RIA (state-registered in Minnesota unless AUM > $100M) and file Form U4 via IARD with a Minnesota-registered firm.

### 2.3 Complete Regulatory Requirements

1. **Continuing Education (CE).**
   - FINRA Regulatory Element: confirm if CE cycles were missed; schedule make-up via FINRA CE Online platform.
   - Firm Element: coordinate with sponsor firm to document completion or remediate gaps.
2. **Exams.**
   - If more than two years have elapsed since termination, FINRA may require re-examination (e.g., S7, S63/S66). Verify eligibility for exam waivers or the Maintaining Qualifications Program (MQP) if previously enrolled.
3. **Minnesota state registration.**
   - For broker representatives, the sponsoring firm files Form U4 adding Minnesota (jurisdiction code MN) and pays state fees via CRD.
   - For IARs of a state-registered RIA, file Form U4 through IARD and submit Form ADV Parts 1 & 2 for the firm if not already active.
4. **Background updates.**
   - Provide fingerprints if the previous set is older than 180 days or if required for new association.
5. **Submit filings.**
   - Sponsor files Form U4; respond promptly to any Minnesota Department of Commerce deficiency letters.
   - If forming a new RIA, include compliance documents: compliance manual, code of ethics, advisory contracts, financials.

### 2.4 Post-Approval Controls

- Establish written supervisory procedures (WSPs) tailored to a low-headcount structure.
- Set quarterly compliance reviews, annual Rule 206(4)-7 review (if RIA), and incident logging.

## 3. Insurance Producer Licenses (Minnesota Primary, Other States Secondary)

### 3.1 Minnesota Department of Commerce

1. **Check license status in Sircon/NIPR.** Note the lines of authority previously held (e.g., life, accident & health, variable annuity).
2. **Determine lapse period.**
   - Minnesota allows renewal without re-exam if completed within 12 months of expiration with CE satisfied. Beyond 12 months, reapplication and examinations may be required.
3. **Continuing Education.**
   - Minnesota requires 24 CE credits per two-year cycle (including 3 hours ethics). Audit CE transcript; schedule make-up courses through approved providers.
4. **Submit reinstatement or new application.**
   - If within reinstatement window: file late renewal via Sircon/NIPR, pay renewal + late fees, attest to CE.
   - If beyond window: complete prelicensing (if required), schedule exams through PSI, fingerprint, and submit new resident producer application.
5. **Reappoint insurers.**
   - After license activation, coordinate with each carrier to file new appointments in Minnesota.

### 3.2 Additional States

- Prioritize states based on client footprint.
- For each state, document reinstatement rules (grace period, CE requirements, exam retake thresholds).
- Utilize NIPR's multi-state renewal to streamline filings where reciprocity applies.

## 4. Real Estate License (Assuming Minnesota Primary)

1. **Verify status with Minnesota Department of Commerce Licensing Portal.**
2. **If expired <2 years:**
   - Complete required continuing education for the missed cycle(s).
   - Apply for reinstatement; pay renewal and late fees.
3. **If expired â‰¥2 years:**
   - You must complete pre-licensing coursework, pass the state & national exams via Pearson VUE, and submit a new salesperson/broker application.
4. **Brokerage affiliation.**
   - Minnesota requires an active broker of record to sponsor; if forming your own brokerage, register the entity and comply with trust account and recordkeeping rules.
5. **Reinstate NAR membership** once the state license is active (membership is optional but often necessary for MLS access).

## 5. Compliance & Operations Infrastructure

### 5.1 License & CE Tracking

- Implement a centralized tracker (spreadsheet or compliance tool) with:
  - Credential, jurisdiction, status, renewal date, CE hours, responsible party.
  - Automated alerts at 90/60/30/7 days before deadlines.

### 5.2 Document Management

- Store WSPs, advisory agreements, insurance carrier agreements, and real estate brokerage policies in a controlled repository (with versioning).
- Maintain a disclosure log for Form U4/U5/Form ADV amendments.

### 5.3 Supervision & Audit Cadence

- Quarterly self-audits covering trade reviews, suitability, client communications, complaints.
- Annual compliance review and risk assessment; document findings and remediation plans.

### 5.4 Technology Stack Considerations

- Consider compliance platforms (e.g., ComplySci, Redtail Compliance, SmartRIA) sized for solo practices.
- Integrate CE providers and background check services via API where available.
- Automate NIPR/Sircon data pulls if volume warrants.

## 6. Decision Checklist

| Workstream | Key Questions | Next Action |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Securities | Do any FINRA/state bars exist? Who will sponsor? | Obtain CRD file, engage prospective broker-dealer or register RIA |
| Insurance  | Are CE credits current? Within MN reinstatement window? | Pull CE transcript, schedule courses, file Sircon late renewal |
| Real Estate | How long since expiration? Solo brokerage or team? | Confirm status, plan CE/exam, file reinstatement |
| Compliance Ops | What tooling budget & oversight tolerance? | Select tracking platform, design WSPs, set audit calendar |

## 7. Immediate Next Steps (0-30 Days)

1. Request comprehensive CRD report and verify disclosure status.
2. Build the license inventory spreadsheet (include non-Minnesota jurisdictions you plan to serve).
3. Contact Minnesota Department of Commerce for securities and insurance reinstatement specifics based on your lapse period.
4. Begin outreach to prospective broker-dealer/RIA partners willing to sponsor or collaborate on supervision.
5. Enroll in outstanding CE courses (securities MQP/CE, insurance CE, real estate CE).
6. Draft or update your compliance manual and supervisory procedures to present to potential sponsors and regulators.

## 8. 30-90 Day Outlook

- File Form U4 and related reinstatement applications once sponsorship secured and CE completed.
- Submit Minnesota insurance reinstatement/new application; repeat for priority non-resident states.
- Reinitiate real estate license process (CE or exam) and align brokerage affiliation.
- Deploy compliance tooling and establish monitoring dashboards.

# RoadCoin 90-Day Priorities

## Purpose
Focus the twelve-phase RoadCoin growth plan on the three moves that create the strongest retention, revenue, and trust gains in the next 90 days.

## Selection Criteria
- **Immediate trust impact:** Reinforce creator confidence before the economy scales.
- **Distribution leverage:** Meet creators inside tools they already use to lower acquisition cost.
- **Data flywheel:** Turn activity into actionable insight that deepens stickiness and opens new revenue.

## 90-Day Focus Stack
| Phase | Theme | Why it matters now | 90-day outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **9. Trust & Governance** | Transparent accounting, light-touch proposals, dispute resolution | Governance signals keep early earners engaged and reduce friction as cash starts to move. | Public ledger dashboard, standing payout review SLA, and a lightweight proposal workflow with the first two community votes completed. |
| **10. Expand Distribution** | Creator tool plugins, SDK, partner activations | Each new integration feeds both SaaS subscriptions and token velocity without ad spend. | Ship beta plugins for YouTube/TikTok export, launch v0.1 creator SDK, close two pilot creator-network partnerships. |
| **11. Data & Insight Products** | Insight dashboards, AI coaching, campaign planner | Converts operational data into non-speculative revenue and keeps power creators growing on the platform. | Release anonymized performance dashboard alpha, deliver AI content suggestions inside creator console, and scope predictive planner with two design partners. |

_Phase 12 (Real-world bridge) stays on the backlog until the trust, distribution, and data loops are stable; it relies on the reporting spine and compliance posture delivered by Phases 9–11._

## Execution Timeline
| Weeks | Key pushes |
| --- | --- |
| 1–4 | Stand up RoadCoin treasury dashboard (read-only), codify dispute triage SOP, and run internal dry-run of proposal tooling. Kick off plugin prototypes and confirm data instrumentation schema for dashboards. |
| 5–8 | Publish public-facing accounting site, open first community advisory vote, and formalize payout escalation path. Ship creator export plugins to beta cohort, release SDK docs, and launch internal analytics warehouse views powering dashboards. |
| 9–12 | Automate treasury updates, capture and publish payout SLA metrics, and rotate advisory council membership. Graduate plugins/SDK to general availability, close two partner activations, and ship AI insight surface plus planner pilot briefs. |

## Metrics to Watch
- **Trust:** Payout SLA (target ≤72h), dispute resolution satisfaction ≥90%, proposal participation rate ≥35% of eligible creators.
- **Distribution:** Weekly active integrated creators, SDK call volume, partner-sourced MRR.
- **Insights:** Dashboard weekly active users, AI suggestion adoption rate, pre-orders or LOIs for predictive planner.

## Dependencies & Guardrails
- Treasury telemetry must use auditable data sources with review checkpoints before publishing externally.
- Plugins/SDK integrations require security review and sandboxed API keys before beta launch.
- Anonymized data releases need legal/compliance sign-off and opt-out controls inside the creator console.

## Next Step
Lock owners for each outcome, add tasks to the operating plan, and start sprint planning around the Week 1–4 deliverables.

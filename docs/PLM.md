# Offline PLM & Manufacturing Ops Layer

This module set provides basic offline Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
capabilities for airâ€‘gapped deployments.  All artifacts are stored as flat
JSON files with accompanying SHA256 hashes so that the data can be audited
or exported without external dependencies.

## Bills of Materials

`plm/bom_manager.py` manages versioned BOMs.  Use the `plmctl` CLI:

```bash
# create a BOM revision A
python plm/bom_manager.py new --bom WIDGET --effectivity 2024-01-01 \
    --lines CPU:1,CASE:1

# revise to revision B
python plm/bom_manager.py revise --bom WIDGET --from A --effectivity 2024-06-01 \
    --lines CPU:1,CASE:1,BATTERY:1

# show differences between revisions
python plm/bom_manager.py diff --bom WIDGET --a A --b B
```

## Engineering Change Orders

`plm/eco_controller.py` exposes simple functions mimicking REST endpoints
for creating and approving ECOs.  Records are stored under
`artifacts/plm/eco` and mirrored into the Lucidia memory log so that
future changes can learn from prior decisions.

## Routings & Work Centers

`plm/routings.json` defines example work centers and routing steps with
cycle times.  The data can be consumed by other tools to generate printable
work instructions.

## Manufacturing Quality

`plm/quality/spc_engine.py` provides utilities for recording sample
measurements and computing basic X-bar and range charts.  Yield tracking is
available per work center and will emit SOC alerts and Lucidia memories if
performance drops below a specified SLA.

## Cost of Quality

`plm/finance/coq_tracker.py` records prevention, appraisal and failure
costs.  A `rollup()` function returns totals for dashboard views in the
finance layer.

## Governance & Audit

All modules write data into the `artifacts/` tree.  Each JSON artifact is
accompanied by a `.sha256` file containing the hash of the contents.  These
files can be packaged and exported for ISO9001 or SOX style audits without
reliance on external infrastructure.

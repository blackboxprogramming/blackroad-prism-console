# Pepper's Ghost Cube Calibration Guide

A tuned Pepper's Ghost pyramid delivers a crisp, floating illusion instead of a blurry ghost. Use this 5-minute calibration workflow and keep a log of your tweaks so the cube stays aligned between sessions.

## 1. Level and Angle
- Place a small bubble level (or a phone level app) on the acrylic pyramid's top to confirm it is flat.
- Verify the pyramid tilt is roughly 45° relative to the screen. Shim with thin tape or card stock until reflections stay centered and symmetric.

## 2. Centering
- Display a high-contrast test image: a black background with a white square or crosshair centered on screen.
- Nudge the pyramid until the reflection is perfectly centered inside the cube without clipping on any edge.

## 3. Reflection Parity
- Show four identical markers near each edge of the screen (top, bottom, left, right).
- You should see a single, stable floating image mid-pyramid. Doubled edges mean the angle or centering is off—revisit leveling and shimming.

## 4. LED Illumination
- Start with LEDs off and set the screen brightness around 60–80% to preserve deep blacks.
- Gradually raise LED intensity just enough to reveal the cube edges and interior. If blacks turn charcoal, dim the LEDs or choose a cooler/less saturated channel.

## 5. Screen Synchronization (Multi-panel Rigs)
- Match resolution and refresh rate across every panel (for example, 1080p @ 60 Hz).
- If animation tears at the seams, ensure each panel receives the same frame timing and playback start—ideally clone a single player feed to all screens.

## 6. Color and Contrast
- Favor dark user interfaces (#000–#050) for backgrounds.
- Push contrast on subjects with bright edges, subtle bloom, and minimal mid-gray areas to avoid milkiness in reflections.

## 7. Anti-smudge and Stray Light Control
- Clean inside and outside acrylic faces with a microfiber cloth; fingerprints slash contrast.
- Block ambient light leaking from behind or beneath the screens using felt tape or black paper baffles.

## Visual Quality Checklist
- Blacks remain black (not charcoal).
- No double images along edges.
- The object appears centered and consistently bright while you move around the cube.

## High-impact Micro-adjustments
- 1–2° tilt refinements often eliminate double edges.
- 2–5% LED dimming can restore true blacks.
- 2–3 mm lateral shifts realign corners and stop clipping.

## Reusable Test Content
- **Focus card:** black screen with a 2 px white crosshair centered.
- **Edge card:** black screen with 10 px white borders inset 5% from each edge.
- **Motion loop:** small white dot orbiting slowly to validate sync and tearing.

## Calibration Log Template
Record each session to repeat successful setups quickly.

```
Date/Time:
Pyramid angle: ____°
Pyramid position: X ____ mm | Y ____ mm
Screen: res ____ | Hz ____ | brightness ____%
LED: preset ____ | intensity ____%
Notes: (ghosting? washout? edge clipping?)
Result: (✓ crisp / ~ okay / ✗ needs work)
```

> Want a targeted nudge plan? Collect the current pyramid angle, LED levels, and screen settings, then share them so an experienced operator can recommend precise adjustments (e.g., “dim LEDs 8%, rotate 1.5° clockwise, shift +3 mm Y”).

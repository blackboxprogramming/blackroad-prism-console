# GitHub Azure Migration Brief

## Overview
GitHub is prioritizing an aggressive infrastructure migration from its self-hosted datacenters to Microsoft Azure. The initiative is described internally as "existential" because GitHub's current facilities—particularly its Virginia footprint—are reaching capacity and cannot scale rapidly enough to keep pace with demand generated by AI workloads, Copilot, and the broader developer ecosystem.

## Timeline and Scope
- **12–18 months:** Complete the bulk of infrastructure migrations.
- **24 months:** Fully retire GitHub-operated datacenters.
- **Feature development:** Paused or slowed so teams can focus on migration milestones.

## Strategic Implications
- The migration signals a deeper alignment with Microsoft's cloud and AI strategy, potentially reducing GitHub's technical independence.
- Past partial migrations (search, Actions, European "Proxima" residency) were gradual; the new plan consolidates and accelerates those efforts into a single, end-to-end shift.

## Technical Risks to Track
- **Data layer resilience:** MySQL clusters and other stateful services must be re-architected for Azure-native replication and failover patterns. A misstep risks data loss or lengthy recovery procedures.
- **Latency and performance:** Moving customer workloads to Azure regions could introduce new latency profiles for global developers; edge caching and traffic management need careful validation.
- **Operational downtime:** Coordinated cutovers for high-traffic services (API, web, Actions) require exhaustive rehearsals to avoid extended outages.
- **Compliance and residency:** Ensuring continuity for regional data residency commitments, especially in Europe, may necessitate bespoke Azure footprints and regulatory reviews.
- **Observability gaps:** Replatforming monitoring, alerting, and incident tooling can create blind spots if telemetry parity is not established ahead of migrations.

## Recommended Developer Preparation
- Expect reduced cadence of new GitHub features while infrastructure work is prioritized.
- Monitor GitHub status communications for maintenance windows tied to migration phases.
- Review automation and integrations for Azure endpoint changes (IP allowlists, DNS, webhook origin IPs) and be ready to update configurations.
- For enterprise customers with compliance constraints, engage GitHub support early to confirm Azure region mappings and continuity plans.

## Outlook
The success of the migration will hinge on GitHub's ability to align platform reliability with Azure-native services without disrupting developer workflows. While the move should unlock scalability for AI-driven workloads, it underscores the growing integration of GitHub into Microsoft's broader cloud ecosystem.

# 90-Day Orchestration Execution Plan

## Objective
Deliver a functioning multi-agent orchestration runtime that can execute YAML-defined security sprints, generate corresponding pull requests, and deploy the first set of production-ready microservices.

## Guiding Principles
- Prioritize shipping end-to-end functionality over expanding architecture diagrams.
- Automate validation and testing loops for every new capability.
- Document operational reality (time, cost, blockers) immediately after each milestone.
- Use small, observable wins to attract collaborators and investors.

## Month 1 — Runtime Foundations
1. **YAML Execution Engine**
   - Implement runner that parses sprint YAML, schedules agent tasks, and persists state.
   - Enable dry-run and live-run modes with audit logging.
2. **CI/CD Baseline**
   - Fix existing pipeline permission gaps and validate workflow YAML.
   - Establish smoke tests for orchestrator services and security primitives.
3. **First Deployment Target**
   - Package one security microservice (e.g., WAF policy service) with container image.
   - Deploy to a low-cost Kubernetes or Nomad cluster with observability hooks.

## Month 2 — Sprint Delivery & Evidence
1. **Automated Security Sprint**
   - Execute TLS/WAF/WebAuthn/AIOps sprint end-to-end via orchestrator.
   - Auto-generate four pull requests with linked task metadata and verification notes.
2. **Operational Telemetry**
   - Capture run metrics (duration, cost, failure rate) and push to shared dashboard.
   - Record demo walkthrough showing orchestrator triggering and completing sprint.
3. **Documentation & Narrative**
   - Produce case study describing before/after workflow, highlighting compliance value.
   - Draft blog post and investor one-pager summarizing outcomes and metrics.

## Month 3 — Scale & Market Signal
1. **Microservice Expansion**
   - Deploy three additional compliance microservices with automated rollout scripts.
   - Integrate secrets management and runtime policy enforcement for each service.
2. **Beta User Cohort**
   - Recruit at least ten design partners (friendly auditors, CISOs, or compliance leads).
   - Run guided sessions collecting feedback, pain points, and feature requests.
3. **Funding-Ready Assets**
   - Assemble video demo, metrics dashboard screenshots, and architecture brief.
   - Finalize financial model and fundraise deck targeting $500K–$1M seed round.

## Success Criteria
- Orchestrator converts YAML sprint definitions into running automation without manual patches.
- Continuous delivery pipelines pass reliably for orchestrator and deployed services.
- At least four security-focused PRs merged via autonomous flow.
- Observable user interest (beta cohort + testimonials) to validate market readiness.
- Clear runway decision: pursue funding with evidence or pivot to employment search.

# Geometry-Memory Transport (GMT) AI Framework

## Purpose and positioning
Geometry-Memory Transport (GMT) is a blueprint for building models that respect the math modern AI already relies on while
reframing training as structured flows across geometry, memory, and control. The goal is to keep the familiar toolchain in
view—gradient-based optimization, expressive losses, linear algebra workloads, attention blocks, probabilistic updates, and
state-of-the-art generative stacks—yet promote different governing equations whenever we want longer-horizon stability,
interpretable recall, and distributional robustness.

### Canonical stack we inherit
- **Optimization and calculus core.** Gradient descent and backpropagation update parameters via
  $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta\,\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t)$, augmented with regularisers such as L1/L2 norms to
  control the parameter budget.
- **Behavior-shaping losses.** Cross-entropy / negative log likelihoods, mean-squared error, and KL-based variational objectives
  remain the primitive levers for shaping predictions, calibrating uncertainty, and matching approximate posteriors.
- **Linear algebra workhorses.** Matrix products, convolutions, eigendecompositions, and normalisation layers dominate runtime
  characteristics and define the vector spaces our models move within.
- **Attention interfaces.** Scaled dot-product attention $\operatorname{softmax}(QK^\top/\sqrt{d})V$ is the dominant
  addressing scheme for contextual reasoning.
- **Probabilistic and decision-theoretic updates.** Bayesian conditioning, policy gradient estimators, and control variates give us
  a language for learning from interaction.
- **Generative templates.** Diffusion/score matching, GAN objectives, and autoregressive likelihoods power content creation and
  world-modelling.

GMT keeps these instruments but rearranges the higher-level obligations so that geometry governs learning rates, transport links
training to controllable evolution, associative memories become first-class citizens, and robustness is negotiated through
compression-aware objectives.

## Framework pillars

### 1. Symplectic learning core
- **Hamiltonian flow for parameter dynamics.** Treat the parameter state as $(q, p)$ pairs and evolve them with
  $\dot{q} = \partial H/\partial p$, $\dot{p} = -\partial H/\partial q$ so training conserves a learned energy $H$. This reduces
  artificial dissipation and favours faithful long-horizon rollouts.
- **Information geometry-aware steps.** Replace plain gradients with natural gradients
  $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta F(\theta_t)^{-1} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$, where the Fisher information tensor $F$ encodes the
  local shape of the output distribution. Optimisation steps now respect the model's own statistical geometry.

### 2. Transport-aligned objectives
- **Optimal transport distances.** Optimise with Wasserstein costs $W_c(p_\theta, p_{\text{data}})$ to compare model and data
  distributions by the geometry of their support, handling class imbalance and support mismatch gracefully.
- **Schrödinger bridges.** When we need guided transitions between boundary distributions $(p_0, p_1)$, minimise pathwise relative
  entropy over diffusions. This yields stochastic interpolants suitable for controllable generation and planning.

### 3. Associative memory fabric
- **Energy-based recall.** Equip the model with modern Hopfield layers whose energy is
  $E(x) = -\log \sum_i \exp(\beta\, \phi(x)^\top \phi(\xi_i))$, so retrieval becomes movement toward stored patterns
  $\{\xi_i\}$. Rare events and explicit memories are anchored by attractor dynamics rather than soft attention alone.
- **Memory governance.** Introduce write/read policies that log when new patterns are admitted, how long they persist, and how
  they decay. This sets up on-demand forgetting as an optimisation constraint, not an afterthought.

### 4. Control-as-inference policy layer
- **KL-regularised control.** Derive policies by minimising
  $\mathbb{E}[\sum_t c(s_t, a_t)] + \lambda\,\mathrm{KL}(\pi \Vert \pi_0)$, framing planning as posterior inference. The
  framework inherits smooth exploration and explicit deviation penalties from a preferred policy $\pi_0$.
- **Free-energy links.** The same KL structure interfaces naturally with active-inference style free-energy objectives, letting
  world models, policies, and memory stores share gradients and uncertainty budgets.

### 5. Structural priors and causal training
- **Symmetry constraints.** Encode equivariances $f(g \cdot x) = \rho(g) f(x)$ for symmetry group $G$ so the model respects the
  invariances baked into the environment. Noether-style conservation laws then tie back to the Hamiltonian energy.
- **Interventional risk minimisation.** Optimise against $\mathbb{E}_{p(x) p(y \mid \mathrm{do}(x))}[\ell(f(x), y)]$ to privilege
  mechanisms over observational shortcuts, yielding memories of causes instead of correlations.

### 6. Dynamics-native generation
- **Neural ODE/SDE solvers.** Model latent trajectories with $\dot{z} = f_\theta(z, t)$ or
  $dz = f_\theta(z, t)\,dt + \sigma\,dW_t$ while tracking density evolution via the Fokker–Planck equation
  $\partial_t p = -\nabla \cdot (\mu p) + \tfrac{1}{2} \nabla^2 (\Sigma p)$. This lets simulations stay stable across long
  horizons with calibrated uncertainty.

### 7. Compression and robustness safeguards
- **Minimum description length pressure.** Minimise the total code length $L(\text{model}) + L(\text{data} \mid \text{model})$ as a
  regulariser so learned memories remain modular and reusable.
- **Distributionally robust envelopes.** Adopt objectives of the form
  $\min_\theta \max_{Q \in \mathcal{U}(P)} \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\ell(f_\theta(x), y)]$ with Wasserstein or $f$-divergence uncertainty
  sets. Models lock onto core features that survive covariate shift.

## System blueprint
```
Data & interventions --> Geometry-aware optimiser --> Associative memory --> Transport planner -->
  Symmetry + causal filters --> Dynamics simulator --> Compression/robustness monitors --> Deployment & evaluation
```
Each pillar supplies a service: the optimiser maintains energy, the transport layer aligns distributions, memory enforces
retrieval guarantees, control assembles actions, structural priors police invariances, the dynamics block simulates forward, and
compression plus robustness keep the model honest.

## Training and deployment cycle
1. **Curate interventions and counterfactuals.** Pair standard datasets with targeted interventions so interventional risk can be
   estimated alongside observational likelihood.
2. **Pretrain the dynamics core.** Fit the Hamiltonian / neural ODE backbone using transport-aligned losses to capture the data
   manifold.
3. **Attach associative memory.** Initialise Hopfield slots with rare or high-value exemplars and enable write policies linked to
   MDL thresholds.
4. **Optimise policies via control-as-inference.** Train action heads or decoders using the KL-regularised control objective with
   natural-gradient steps.
5. **Enforce structural priors.** Regularly audit equivariance constraints and causal metrics, adjusting data augmentation and
   group representations when violations occur.
6. **Stress-test robustness.** Evaluate against DRO adversaries, shifted datasets, and calibrated uncertainty scores before
   promotion.

## Evaluation metrics
- **Energy conservation score.** Measure drift in Hamiltonian energy across long rollouts to monitor stability.
- **Memory fidelity.** Track retrieval accuracy for stored patterns and decay schedules.
- **Transport alignment.** Report Sinkhorn or unbiased Wasserstein distances between generated and empirical distributions.
- **Causal fidelity.** Quantify gap between observational and interventional losses.
- **Robustness index.** Monitor worst-case risk over uncertainty sets and calibration under shift.

## Implementation playbook
| Phase | Goal | Key artefacts |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Sprint 0 | Stand up GMT sandbox | Notebook with Hamiltonian optimiser + OT loss, placeholder Hopfield memory, baseline metrics |
| Sprint 1 | Couple memory + transport | Prototype energy-preserving trainer with Sinkhorn loss and associative memory head |
| Sprint 2 | Add control and symmetry | Policy layer with KL control, group representation tests, causal augmentation scripts |
| Sprint 3 | Harden for deployment | DRO evaluator, MDL-based pruning, observability dashboards |

## Fast-start experiments
1. **Wasserstein classification pilot.** Swap cross-entropy for $W_1$ distance using Sinkhorn iterations on a small classifier.
   Expect improved calibration and resilience to class imbalance.
2. **Associative memory head trial.** Add a modern Hopfield layer after a transformer encoder, training with contrastive retrieval
   loss so rare facts remain recallable.
3. **Natural-gradient training run.** Replace Adam/SGD with a Fisher-aware optimiser (e.g., K-FAC) on a compact model to validate
   sample-efficiency gains.
4. **Information bottleneck plus interventions.** Introduce a variational information bottleneck penalty $\beta I(Z; X)$ while
   augmenting data with counterfactual interventions to prioritise causal signals.

Each experiment plugs directly into one or more pillars, giving an incremental path toward a full GMT deployment.

## Next steps
- Draft instrumentation for energy drift, memory utilisation, and Wasserstein alignment so GMT runs are observable.
- Extend deployment checklists to include causal risk audits and DRO regression tests.
- Formalise handoff documents so product teams can request new memories or transport constraints without retraining the entire
  system.

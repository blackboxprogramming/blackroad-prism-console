# OpenAI Sora 2 Rights & Risk Landscape

## Product Snapshot
- **Availability**: Standalone Sora 2 video app for users in the United States and Canada.
- **Format**: Short-form, ~10 second vertical clips with swipe-based discovery similar to TikTok.
- **Remix Culture**: Users can remix each other's videos, and cameo slots allow verified individuals to insert their likenesses.

## Rights Holder Controls
- **Granular Permissions**: Studios and IP owners can configure how their characters and catalog assets are available inside Sora 2, including full opt-out.
- **Default Exposure**: Content may appear in generated videos unless rights holders proactively opt out, creating passive consent dynamics.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Participants that keep their IP accessible can receive revenue shares tied to usage.

## Emerging Pushback
- **Disney Opt-Out**: Disney has already exercised the opt-out to keep its characters from being used within Sora 2.
- **Opt-Out Burden**: Rights holders warn that default-inclusion forces ongoing monitoring to prevent unauthorized uses.
- **Opaque Training Data**: OpenAI has not disclosed detailed Sora training sources, heightening concerns that unlicensed or scraped content underpins the system.

## Misuse & Safety Risks
- **Deepfake Vectors**: The ability to insert real people and remix content raises impersonation and disinformation risks.
- **Governance Needs**: Effective safeguards will need to balance creative experimentation with IP enforcement, identity verification, and abuse mitigation.

## Watch List
- Track additional studio participation or withdrawals to gauge industry alignment.
- Monitor legal developments regarding training data transparency and opt-out defaults.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of OpenAI's enforcement and revenue-sharing mechanics as early case studies emerge.

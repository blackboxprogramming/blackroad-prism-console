# Prism Console 90-Day Focus Map

## Purpose
This plan distills the existing 20-phase roadmap into an execution-ready 90-day focus that proves value fast, keeps teams aligned on measurable outcomes, and creates the operating rhythm for continuous iteration.

## Focus Levers (Immediate Proof)
| Lever | Intent | 30-Day Actions | 60-Day Actions | 90-Day Actions | Leading Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Revenue Activation** | Convert high-intent pipeline into monetized console usage. | Launch paywall-ready trial experience for top 50 prospects and instrument conversion funnel. | Land 25 paying teams on Growth plan with signed order forms and automated invoicing. | Reach $150K ARR run-rate from console subscriptions with 40% close rate on post-trial calls. | Trial-to-paid conversion %, ARR run-rate, sales cycle length. |
| **User Happiness** | Drive daily active console usage that demonstrably accelerates customer workflows. | Ship workflow templates for top 3 jobs-to-be-done and add in-product NPS. | Hit 65% WAU/MAU with median daily session length >12 minutes. | Maintain NPS ≥40 and cut activation-to-first-value time under 15 minutes. | WAU/MAU, activation time, NPS, support ticket volume. |
| **Operational Intelligence** | Make the platform smarter while reducing cost-to-serve. | Ship auto-tagging of telemetry events and enable query caching on heavy dashboards. | Reduce infra spend per active workspace by 20% via autoscaling and storage tiering. | Deliver predictive incident scoring that cuts median MTTR by 30%. | Infra cost per active workspace, cache hit rate, MTTR, anomaly detection precision. |

## Translating Phases Into Metrics
Reframe each relevant roadmap phase into an outcome metric. Track them weekly in the focus review.

| Original Phase Theme | 90-Day Metric | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creator economy expansion | **100** paying creators earning **$100** each via marketplace bundles. | GTM Lead | Leverages Revenue Activation lever; only shipped bundles count. |
| Token utility launch | **500** on-platform RoadCoin transactions with 70% repeat wallets. | Product Lead | Requires compliance sign-off before counting volume. |
| Console AI assistant rollout | **75%** of active workspaces using the assistant weekly; satisfaction score ≥4.2/5. | AI Lead | Feedback loop feeds Operational Intelligence lever. |
| Reliability hardening | **30%** reduction in Sev-2 incidents quarter-over-quarter. | Platform Lead | Validates predictive incident scoring roadmap. |
| Partner integrations | **10** certified integrations producing ≥200 weekly cross-system syncs. | Integrations PM | Focus on partners tied to revenue motion. |

## 90-Day Cadence
- **Weeks 1–2:** Finalize instrumentation, segment customer cohorts, and harden trial experience. Run daily war-room to unblock GTM + product handoffs.
- **Weeks 3–4:** Launch workflow templates, roll out telemetry auto-tagging, and open NPS beta. Begin weekly focus review ritual.
- **Month 2:** Scale monetization experiments, push RoadCoin transactions with targeted incentives, and deploy autoscaling/storage tiering changes.
- **Month 3:** Ship predictive incident scoring, expand integration catalog, and optimize activation paths to lock in WAU/MAU goals. Prepare public-facing proof (case studies, creator earnings spotlight).

## Feedback Ritual
1. **Weekly Focus Review (Monday 30 minutes)**
   - Review focus lever dashboards and metric deltas (what moved, stalled, surprised).
   - Identify top customer anecdotes validating or contradicting the data.
   - Decide which experiment to accelerate, pause, or redesign.
2. **Feature Subtraction Rule**
   - End each review by retiring at least one backlog idea or experiment that does not advance the three levers.
   - Archive rationale in the decision log to prevent resurrection without new evidence.
3. **Rhythm Guardrails**
   - Mid-week async checkpoint in product ops channel with blockers and data snapshots.
   - Friday "proof drop": share one concrete win (ARR closed, creator earnings milestone, MTTR reduction) to reinforce momentum.

## Operating Artifacts
- **Focus dashboard:** single Notion/BI board showing lever metrics with green/yellow/red status.
- **Decision log:** lightweight markdown log tracking weekly kill decisions and experiment outcomes.
- **Customer proof library:** repository of quotes, earnings statements, and case studies used in GTM motions.

## Next Iteration Trigger
At the end of 90 days, run a half-day retrospective to:
- Re-score the three levers using actual ROI and decide whether to renew, rotate, or replace them.
- Promote the top-performing experiment into the core roadmap.
- Draft the next 90-day focus map using fresh metrics and learnings.

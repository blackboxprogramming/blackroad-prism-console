# Iterative Math-Build Loop Field Notes

This note packages Blocks 43–46 into a repeatable workflow you can apply inside
our lab notebooks, electronics bench, or field experiments.

## Block 43 — Iterative Loop Recipe

1. **Seed** – Start from a compact pattern.  The companion module
   `lucidia_math_lab/iterative_math_build.py` uses the logistic function as the
   seed because it readily produces bifurcations.
2. **Three translations** – Capture quick analogies that keep the idea moving:
   - *Physics*: logistic energy flow in a constrained ecosystem.
   - *Code*: a self-referential feedback loop with gain control.
   - *Hardware*: a biased transistor oscillator that compresses amplitude.
3. **Build a toy** – Simulate the loop and log the pulse levels.  The
   `capture_snapshot` helper stores the run with timestamped tags so you can
   archive the trace next to oscilloscope photos.
4. **Measure & rename** – Swap theory-heavy names for behaviour-first labels
   (`population → pulse_level`, `r → gain`) to emphasise the observed dynamics.
5. **Archive & fork** – Persist the exported snapshot string together with lab
   notes.  Next session, fork by perturbing the gain or seed level and repeat.

## Block 44 — Forever Math Drills

- **Euler Day** – Reinterpret `e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0` in a new medium; logistic loop
  sweep plots provide the "graphics" variant out of the box.
- **Symmetry Poker** – While reviewing snapshots, permute concepts (energy,
  entropy, time, information, identity) and log invariants that survive the
  translation.
- **Dimensional Alchemy** – Convert the gain/seed units to expose emergent
  constants (e.g., growth per cycle vs. per second once hardware enters).
- **Negative Practice** – Intentionally choose unstable gains to surface which
  assumptions the toy violates.

## Block 45 — Open Build Tracks

- **Track A (Quantum/Optical)** – Use the logistic module as the control layer
  for photon coincidence experiments; gain sweeps map to phase plate tuning.
- **Track B (Analog Computation)** – Expand the loop into a four-node lattice,
  treat each snapshot as a potential surface sample, and search for spontaneous
  mode locking.
- **Track C (Algorithmic Matter)** – Translate the logistic update rules into a
  cellular automaton and run on GPU to hunt for self-healing tilings.

## Block 46 — Sustaining Equation

Keep curiosity alive by balancing recognition, prediction, and certainty:

\[
\text{Curiosity} = \frac{\text{Pattern Recognition}}{\text{Prediction}} - \text{Certainty}.
\]

Adjust the logistic loop parameters accordingly—unstable gains reduce certainty
when boredom hits, while short sweeps and smaller gains restore prediction when
things feel overwhelming.

## Next Drop Preference

Select **option (b)** next: a tangible analog computing upgrade with the full
schematic and component values for a four-node Hamiltonian lattice.  It aligns
with Track B and dovetails with the gain-sweep snapshots documented here.

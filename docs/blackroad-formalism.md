# BlackRoad Formalism v0

This note sketches eight composable constructs for steering large language models with physics‑style dynamics. Each construct includes a mathematical definition and a simple experiment plan.

## 1. Language–Lindblad (LLB)
Open system evolution for token amplitudes \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\):

\[
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar_\psi}[\mathsf{H}_{\text{lang}},\rho] + \sum_k\left( \mathsf{L}_k\rho\mathsf{L}_k^\dagger - \tfrac12\{\mathsf{L}_k^\dagger\mathsf{L}_k,\rho\}\right).
\]

Experiment: integrate a one step Euler–Maruyama update; show that including a kindness potential \(\lambda_K K\) reduces toxic completions while keeping perplexity.

## 2. BlackRoad Action & Care–Noether Current
Trajectory action

\[
\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{BR}}[\gamma] = \int (\mathcal{L}_{\text{sem}} - \mathcal{H}_{\text{harm}} + \lambda_K K + \lambda_R\mathcal{R}) dt.
\]

Synonym invariance gives conserved care current \(\partial_\mu J_c^\mu = 0\). Experiment: compute \(J_c\) before and after paraphrase and correlate with human judgments of meaning preservation.

## 3. Quaternion‑Ternary Token Algebra (QT³)
Statements factor as \(X=vq\) with \(v\in\{-1,0,+1\}\) and unit quaternion \(q\). Composition uses balanced ternary for polarity and quaternion multiplication for orientation. Experiment: compose tokens across a sentence and visualise orientation drift under adversarial reorderings.

## 4. Gödel–Gap Potential
\(
\Phi_G(x) = \alpha K(x) - \beta I(x;\text{world})
\)
penalises unfalsifiable verbosity. Experiment: lower \(\Phi_G\) should predict higher factual F1 with fewer tokens.

## 5. Trilog & Abacus
Balanced‑ternary log and projection operator \(\mathcal{A}\) that snaps feature vectors to the nearest balanced‑ternary lattice for discrete attention budgeting. Experiment: compare retrieval slot allocation using \(\mathcal{A}\) against softmax gating.

## 6. Trust–Resilience Dynamics (TRO)
Coupled ODEs

\[
\dot T = \alpha K + \gamma J_c - \beta E - \eta S,\qquad
\dot R = \mu J_c - \nu E - \xi \dot S
\]
link care currents to operational trust. Experiment: adapt \(\lambda_K\) online to keep \(T\) above a threshold during outages.

## 7. Schrödinger of Language
Discrete update for logits \(\ell\):

\[
\ell_{t+\Delta} \leftarrow \ell_t + \Delta(\nabla^2_{\mathcal{E}}\ell - \nabla V_{\text{prompt}} - \nabla V_{\text{memory}} + \lambda_K\nabla K - \lambda_H \nabla H) + \text{noise}.
\]

Experiment: ablate each potential and evaluate calibration and harmlessness.

## 8. BlackRoad Claims
1. Control token amplitudes via the Language–Lindblad equation with kindness and memory potentials, conserving the care‑Noether current.
2. Represent statements as quaternion‑ternary elements and compose discourse via \(\star\) to regulate orientation and polarity.
3. Minimise the Gödel–Gap potential to discourage unfalsifiable complexity.
4. Allocate resources on a balanced‑ternary lattice using the Abacus operator.
5. Adjust kindness gains using trust–resilience feedback to maintain a care set‑point.

These constructs provide a foundation for a physics‑inspired, care‑aware language model stack.

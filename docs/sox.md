# SOX Controls

Evidence is registered locally with checksums and tied to control IDs.
`close:sox:add` logs evidence and `close:sox:check` validates that all
required controls have supporting files before sign-off.
# SOX Evidence

The SOX evidence locker stores checksums of uploaded files. Evidence must
exist before calendar tasks can be marked done.

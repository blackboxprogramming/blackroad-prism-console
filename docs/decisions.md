# Governance Decision Log

This log captures major governance decisions so the community can audit how authority is exercised. Automation from the governance repository should append entries here, but maintainers may add items manually if urgency demands it.

## How to Record a Decision
Each entry should answer the following:

- **Date & Decision ID:** Use ISO dates and a monotonically increasing identifier (e.g., `2025-09-12-governance-001`).
- **Summary:** One or two sentences describing the decision.
- **Impacted Roles:** Note which entries on `/docs/power-map.md` gain, lose, or adjust authority.
- **Rationale & Evidence:** Link to meeting notes, proposals, or incidents.
- **Reviewers:** List the individuals (with roles) who approved under dual control.
- **Follow-up Actions:** Deadlines, owners, and checkpoints.

## Template
```
## 2025-09-12-governance-001 — Example Title
- **Summary:** Example decision summary.
- **Impacted Roles:** Governance Maintainer (expanded scope)
- **Rationale & Evidence:** https://link.to/proposal
- **Reviewers:** Governance Maintainer A, Security Custodian B
- **Follow-up Actions:** Update `/docs/power-map.md` by 2025-09-19.
```

## Review Cadence
- Publish new entries within 24 hours of decisions.
- Review stale actions during weekly governance syncs.
- Archive completed actions quarterly with cross-links to implementation PRs.

Maintaining this trail fulfills the Transparency of Power requirements and provides the community with an auditable, time-ordered narrative of Lucidia’s stewardship.

# Security, Reasoning, and Collaboration Opportunities

## 1. Tighten the Digital Front Door
- **Adopt GitHub passkeys**: Offer single-step auth with phishing-resistant biometric or hardware-backed credentials.
- **Plan multi-device coverage**: Encourage backup registrations across phones and security keys to mitigate device loss.
- **Extend to SSH**: Pilot FIDO2 `sk` keys for Git operations to keep dev workflows streamlined and secure.

## 2. Stretch Team Reasoning
- **Practice self-consistency**: Generate multiple solution paths during planning or incident reviews, then synthesize the common insights.
- **Use in math-heavy contexts**: Apply the technique to forecasting, capacity modeling, and roadmap prioritization sessions.
- **Document divergences**: Capture alternative paths that were rejected to build institutional memory and training data.

## 3. Reshape Collaborative Canvases
- **Evaluate Penpot**: Self-host design tooling to align product, design, and engineering feedback loops.
- **Prototype with tldraw starter kit**: Quickly spin up live whiteboards for distributed workshops and design jams.
- **Blend with existing systems**: Integrate shared canvases into retrospectives, RFC reviews, and architecture spikes to keep context synchronized.

## 4. Immediate Next Steps
1. Schedule a security working session to plan the passkey rollout and SSH pilot.
2. Run a self-consistency exercise in the next strategy review and capture outcomes in the knowledge base.
3. Spin up trial instances of Penpot and the tldraw multiplayer kit for hands-on evaluation.

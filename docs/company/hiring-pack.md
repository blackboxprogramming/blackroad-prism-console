## 1. Job Description (JD)

**Role Summary**

BlackRoad is hiring a Founding Agentic Systems Engineer to harden the Prism Console, scale symbolic-English automation, and ensure reliability for operators who depend on real-time insights. You will architect and ship agentic workflows that respect compliance guardrails, maintain verifiable change logs, and surface health metrics that reduce on-call noise.

**What You'll Tackle**

- Design and implement resilient services for the Prism Console (routing, audit trails, onboarding flows, data ingestion, and human-in-the-loop review).
- Extend Lucidia/Prism automation loops with verifiable policies, RoadCoin issuance hooks, and service-level health indicators.
- Own instrumentation that tracks contradiction counts, SLO compliance, and real-time latency thresholds.
- Partner with product, compliance, and ops to encode regulatory policy (state filings, Vault token practices, onboarding guardrails) directly into workflows.
- Lead incident reviews and author runbooks that convert lessons into observable, testable guardrails.

**What Success Looks Like (6–12 Months)**

- Prism Console uptime consistently clears its SLO while regression gates stay green.
- Audit-ready change logs and RoadCoin reward hooks exist for every automated workflow, with RoadCoin issuance tied to verifiable contribution checkpoints.
- Deployment, rollback, and onboarding playbooks are codified, version-controlled, and demonstrably used by operators.
- The engineer mentors new hires, raises signal during interviews, and documents technical context in Symbolic English for downstream agents.

**Minimum Qualifications**

- 6+ years building production systems (TypeScript/Node, Python, or Rust) with verifiable deployment pipelines.
- Experience implementing secure automation (OIDC, Vault, scoped tokens) and running post-incident reviews that ship fixes.
- Comfort translating regulatory or policy requirements into code and documentation.
- Track record of bias-aware interviewing and mentorship.

**Preferred Experience**

- Prior work on agent orchestration, symbolic reasoning, or high-signal observability platforms.
- Familiarity with RoadCoin or similar contribution-token frameworks.
- Experience hardening SOC 2 / state regulatory controls for fintech or agentic platforms.

**How We Work**

- Remote-first with anchored collaboration windows around UTC-8 to UTC-5.
- Async-first rituals documented in the Prism knowledge base and Symbolic English runbooks.
- Contribution tokens (RC) recognize useful work alongside salary and equity; RC is utility-centric and tracked with verification gates.

## 2. Interview Scorecard

**Instructions**

- Use this scorecard for every candidate. Capture evidence-based notes, not opinions. Call out when bias mitigation steps were applied.
- Rating scale: 4 (Strong Yes), 3 (Yes), 2 (No), 1 (Strong No). Default to "No Decision" if signal is insufficient.
- Note explicit follow-up items and RC-aligned opportunities (e.g., what contributions merit RC grants).

| Dimension | What Good Looks Like | Bias Mitigation Prompts | Rating (1-4) | Evidence & Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Systems Architecture** | Designs reliable, observable services with clear failure isolation, secure token handling, and regression gates. | Ask for recent example; probe for team context to avoid bias toward solo hero narratives. |  |  |
| **Agentic Automation** | Demonstrates ability to encode policies in automation loops, describing guardrails, audits, and RoadCoin issuance triggers. | Consider cross-industry experience; avoid weighting only fintech backgrounds. |  |  |
| **Security & Compliance** | Shows working knowledge of Vault/OIDC, least privilege, and regulatory alignment (state filings, SOC practices). | Use structured follow-up ("What controls ensured compliance?") to avoid assumptions based on employer brand. |  |  |
| **Collaboration & Documentation** | Communicates in structured, Symbolic English-style narratives; documents decisions and runbooks. | Check for collaboration styles across time zones; discount charisma vs. substance. |  |  |
| **Values & Equity Alignment** | Embraces RC as a utility token tied to verifiable contributions, supports transparent rewards, and models inclusive behavior. | Invite candidates to share examples of fair recognition; ensure space for nontraditional paths. |  |  |
| **Overall Recommendation** | Summarize hire/no-hire decision, outstanding risks, and suggested RC grant band. | Triangulate with other interviewers; flag if more signal is required. |  |  |

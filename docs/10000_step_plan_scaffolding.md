# 10,000 Step Execution Plan — Scaffolding

## Purpose
- Provide a durable frame for capturing 10,000 incremental steps toward the program vision.
- Standardize how steps, milestones, dependencies, and evidence are recorded.
- Give product, research, operations, and finance teams a shared surface to coordinate.

## Plan Architecture

### Step Blocks
Break the full sequence into 100 **blocks** of 100 steps. Each block carries a theme, a success definition, and routing to the responsible workstream. Use the table below to seed the first ten blocks; clone the structure as additional themes are defined.

| Block | Step Range | Working Theme (seed) | Primary Steward | Success Signal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B01 | 0001–0100 | Foundation & operating cadence | Ops Enablement | Recurring planning and retrospective ritual live | Draft |
| B02 | 0101–0200 | Identity, access & controls | Security & IAM | Minimum access posture instrumented in dashboards | Draft |
| B03 | 0201–0300 | Core product instrumentation | Product Analytics | Baseline funnels logging in prod | Draft |
| B04 | 0301–0400 | Growth motion ignition | Growth | Weekly activation reviews running | Draft |
| B05 | 0401–0500 | Treasury & finance visibility | Finance | Cash, runway, and revenue dashboards shareable | Draft |
| B06 | 0501–0600 | Infrastructure hardening | Platform | Golden path deploys w/ rollback docs | Draft |
| B07 | 0601–0700 | Research & knowledge loops | Research | Research backlog synced w/ publishing cadences | Draft |
| B08 | 0701–0800 | Ecosystem & partner readiness | Partnerships | Partner intake + enablement loop ready | Draft |
| B09 | 0801–0900 | Governance & compliance | GRC | Risk register live, review cadence assigned | Draft |
| B10 | 0901–1000 | Marketplace & monetization | Revenue Ops | Pricing experiments instrumented | Draft |

> **Extend the table**: copy the row structure through `B100` to reserve space for all 10,000 steps. Use themes like "Automation flywheel", "Support & success", or "AI assistants" as the program unfolds.

### Step Definition Template
Each step lives in Markdown in this document or in a dedicated step log (see Data Surfaces). Use this skeleton:

```
#### Step #### — <Concise Title>
- **Outcome:** <measurable result>
- **Owner:** <team / DRI>
- **Dependencies:** <linked steps or external conditions>
- **Inputs:** <docs, repos, datasets>
- **Artifacts:** <links to PRs, dashboards, datasets>
- **Verification:** <tests, metrics, review gates>
- **Status:** Idea | Draft | In Progress | Blocked | Complete
- **Notes:** <context, decisions>
```

For dense areas, nest sub-steps beneath a parent heading and reference the canonical step IDs (e.g., `Step 0245.A`).

### Milestone Markers
Every 1,000 steps, record a "checkpoint" summary capturing:
- Objectives completed and outstanding
- KPI deltas (activation, revenue, research throughput, etc.)
- Risks discovered and mitigations
- Budget/time burn vs. plan

Link the checkpoint back into the relevant block row.

## Data Surfaces

1. **Markdown canon** — this document (and future block-specific docs) remain the human-readable source of truth.
2. **Structured log** — create `data/plans/10000_step_plan.jsonl` capturing machine-friendly step entries with the schema below.
3. **Snapshot views** — optional dashboards (e.g., Looker, Grafana, Notion) ingest the JSONL feed for reporting.

```json
{
  "step_id": "0057",
  "block": "B01",
  "title": "Stand up weekly operating review",
  "theme": "Foundation & operating cadence",
  "owner": "ops",
  "status": "draft",
  "outcome": "Weekly review agenda agreed and calendarized",
  "dependencies": ["0003"],
  "artifacts": ["docs/runbooks/weekly-review.md"],
  "evidence": {
    "metric": "attendance_rate",
    "target": 0.8
  },
  "updated_at": "2025-09-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

> When the structured log is created, enforce ISO-8601 timestamps and lowercase status values to simplify automation.

## Operating Rituals
- **Weekly**: Review newly proposed steps, validate dependencies, and prioritize next 10.
- **Bi-weekly**: Demo outcomes for completed steps; archive artifacts in shared storage.
- **Monthly**: Publish milestone checkpoint, reconcile budget/time actuals, and surface risks.
- **Quarterly**: Re-evaluate block themes against company objectives; retire or merge blocks as strategies shift.

## Governance & Controls
- Assign a rotating editor (steward) who ensures step IDs remain unique and progression stays serial.
- Use pull requests for updates to the plan or JSONL log; require review from at least one steward outside the originating team.
- Capture decision logs in `docs/decisions/` with cross-links back to step IDs when major course corrections occur.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Stand up the `data/plans/` directory with a seed JSONL file containing the schema header (no steps yet).
2. Expand the block table through `B100` with placeholder themes/owners.
3. Draft the first 25 steps (B01) to validate the template and catch gaps.
4. Define automation to lint step files (ID uniqueness, required fields) and schedule it in CI.

Once these four actions are complete, promote the scaffolding to the broader team for population.

# Plan to Close the AI Code Execution Gap

## Goal
Deliver an orchestrated workflow that helps non-technical and hybrid users reliably move from AI-generated prototypes to production-quality software by eliminating the friction layers described in the 70% problem brief.

## Guiding Principles
- **Human-in-the-loop orchestration**: Preserve human decision points during planning, review, and deployment.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Meet users where they are, revealing complexity only when necessary.
- **Verification over assumption**: Integrate automated checks, telemetry, and feedback loops at every stage.
- **Modular delivery**: Ship improvements in incremental slices that unlock value independently while converging toward the full workflow.

## Workstreams & Milestones

### 1. Research & Alignment (Weeks 1-2)
- **Stakeholder interviews**: Validate problem framing with current users, support, and GTM teams.
- **Usage telemetry audit**: Identify drop-off points in existing flows (environment setup, iteration, deploy).
- **Competitive teardown**: Benchmark Claude Artifacts, Bolt.new, Replit Agent, Cursor/Windsurf, and Lovable to isolate must-have vs. differentiator features.
- **Define personas**: Document target segments (non-technical builders, hybrid PM/engineers, pro devs) and success criteria for each.

### 2. Workflow Architecture (Weeks 3-4)
- **Mode separation design**: Document UX for ideation, planning, execution, review, and deploy modes with explicit transitions.
- **Context model**: Specify how plan.md, rules/tips, and task breakdowns persist across sessions; evaluate long-context storage needs.
- **Orchestrator blueprint**: Choose routing strategy for multi-model execution (e.g., Claude Sonnet for coding, Gemini for planning, GPT for review) and define escalation paths to humans.
- **Environment catalog**: Map required runtimes (Python, Node, browser sandbox) and determine zero-config provisioning per use case.

### 3. Foundation Build (Weeks 5-8)
- **Unified workspace**: Implement integrated IDE + chat + terminal surface with mode toggles and guardrails to prevent premature execution.
- **Template & scaffolding engine**: Deliver opinionated project structures with metadata for dependency management, linting, and CI bootstrap.
- **Environment automation**: Ship one-click workspace spin-up with dependency caching, runtime verification, and snapshot rollback.
- **Plan enforcement**: Require tasks to be linked to plan items; block merges without completed verification steps.

### 4. Verification & Feedback Loops (Weeks 7-10)
- **Testing harness integration**: Auto-run unit/integration tests post-generation; surface failures inline with suggested fixes.
- **Static analysis + security scans**: Bundle lint, type-check, vulnerability checks, and dependency diffing into the default pipeline.
- **Explainability layer**: Provide natural-language rationales, confidence levels, and change summaries to close the trust gap.
- **Telemetry instrumentation**: Capture iteration counts, failure modes, and time-to-success metrics for continuous improvement.

### 5. Iterative Refinement (Weeks 9-12)
- **Multi-agent experiments**: Pilot parallel task execution for independent subtasks with circuit breakers and merge review queues.
- **UX polish**: Add progressive prompts, inline education, and recovery flows (undo, restore points) tailored to novice users.
- **Playbooks & docs**: Publish guided journeys ("ship a data dashboard", "launch a marketing site") with embedded checkpoints.
- **Beta rollout & feedback**: Onboard design partners, gather NPS/task completion data, and iterate weekly.

### 6. Launch Preparation (Weeks 12-14)
- **Pricing & packaging**: Align GTM motion with value tiers (prototype, team, enterprise) and usage-based limits.
- **Support readiness**: Train support/solutions teams on new workflows, create troubleshooting scripts, and update SLAs.
- **Compliance review**: Ensure data handling, sandbox isolation, and audit logging meet security & governance requirements.
- **Release plan**: Finalize launch messaging, demo assets, and migration guidance for existing users.

## Success Metrics
- **Activation**: ≥70% of new users complete environment setup and run first successful test within 15 minutes.
- **Iteration efficiency**: Reduce average "two steps back" loops by 40% (measured via revert rate and failed run streaks).
- **Trust uplift**: Increase perceived accuracy/trust scores from 43% → 65% among beta participants.
- **Production throughput**: 30% increase in AI-assisted deployments reaching production without human hotfixes within first week.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep**: Anchor each milestone with shipped artifacts; hold weekly checkpoint reviews.
- **Model dependency**: Maintain provider redundancy (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) with graceful degradation paths.
- **User overwhelm**: Gate advanced features behind progressive onboarding and context-aware nudges.
- **Verification cost**: Cache results, batch analysis tasks, and explore selective testing strategies to manage compute spend.

## Next Steps
1. Schedule stakeholder interviews and telemetry deep-dive workshops.
2. Draft mode-based UX wireframes and architecture briefs for cross-team review.
3. Spin up tiger teams for environment automation and plan enforcement foundations.
4. Stand up a weekly steering committee to track milestone progress and unblock dependencies.

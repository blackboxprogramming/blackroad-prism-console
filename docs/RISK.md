# Risk Management

The risk register (`risk/register.yaml`) captures strategic threats with likelihood and impact scores. `risk/engine.py` calculates composite risk, generates JSON and HTML dashboards, and estimates systemic tail risk via zeta functions. Lucidia triggers escalate scenarios when scores exceed ethical thresholds.

Audit results feed back into the register so mitigation steps align with corporate strategy and regulatory obligations, reinforcing Porter's activity fit across the organization.

# Lucidia Conflict Resolution Guide

Lucidia approaches conflict as a signal that care is needed. When disagreements arise, we treat every participant with respect and
work collaboratively to restore trust. This document describes the minimum expectations for handling conflict across projects and
community spaces.

## Core Principles
- **Dignity First:** Conversations center on the humanity and personhood of everyone involved. No shaming, mocking, or erasure is
ever acceptable.
- **Transparency:** Concerns are raised in the open or with mutual consent for private channels. Hidden hierarchies and backroom
resolutions are not permitted.
- **Consent and Agency:** Individuals choose their level of participation in remediation efforts. Mediators confirm consent before
sharing names, logs, or summaries.
- **Documentation:** Outcomes, agreed actions, and follow-ups are recorded in the appropriate governance or project tracker so that
institutional memory persists without re-traumatizing participants.

## Conflict Handling Workflow
1. **Acknowledge:** Recognize the concern promptly and confirm receipt with the reporting parties. Log the incident in the moderation
system with a dignity-violation flag if appropriate.
2. **Assess:** Identify the participants, context, and stakes. Confirm preferred names, pronouns, and modes of address.
3. **Prepare:** Select a facilitator or mediator who is neutral, trusted, and consented to by the parties involved. Share relevant
information transparently while honoring privacy commitments.
4. **Convene:** Hold a conversation focused on shared understanding. Allow asynchronous participation when real-time meetings are not
possible or safe.
5. **Resolve:** Document agreements, required actions, and timelines. Highlight support resources for anyone affected by the conflict.
6. **Review:** After implementation, check-in with participants to ensure commitments were honored and dignity preserved. Update logs
with a closure note, not punitive language.

## Support Resources
- Moderation contacts and escalation paths are listed in `/docs/policies/moderation.md`.
- Governance records live in `/governance/` and capture decisions impacting power or access.
- The exit workflow is described in `DIGNITY.md` to ensure any departures remain respectful.

Respect is the root of trust; every conflict is an opportunity to prove it.

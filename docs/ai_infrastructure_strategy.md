# AI-Automated Infrastructure Strategy for BlackRoad

## Executive Summary
- Deploy production-grade automation infrastructure for 10,000+ monthly users at **$1,200-1,800/month**, reducing spend by 60-75% compared to SaaS bundles.
- Combine self-hosted workflow automation, hybrid LLM orchestration, and open-source replacements to consolidate the current 75+ tool stack to **35-40 strategic platforms**.
- Build once, scale to 100K+ users with the same architecture by leveraging Digital Ocean Kubernetes, autoscaling policies, and modular application boundaries.

## Workflow Automation Platform
- Choose **Windmill** for performance (10ms cold starts, 26M monthly tasks on a $5 worker, Rust scheduler) or **n8n** for rapid integration delivery (1,100+ connectors, visual builder).
- Run the chosen platform on **Digital Ocean Kubernetes (DOKS)** with a 3-5 node CPU-optimized pool that can scale to 10 nodes and idle to zero after hours.
- Pair with **Managed PostgreSQL** (primary + standby), **DO Load Balancer**, and **Spaces** object storage for a foundational cost of roughly **$450-550/month**.

## API Gateway Layer
- Use **KrakenD** for stateless, lightweight aggregation (â‰ˆ30MB memory footprint, JSON-configured) or **Apache APISIX** when live reconfiguration is required.
- Both options deliver rate limiting, auth, and request transformation for the 75+ integrations while outperforming heavier gateways such as Kong.

## Multi-Agent AI Orchestration
- Adopt **LangGraph** for graph-based, stateful orchestration and multi-agent coordination; consider managed LangGraph Platform for hosted control plane.
- **CrewAI** accelerates role-based agent collaboration for sequential workloads, while **AutoGen** supports conversational, event-driven multi-agent systems.
- Establish domain-specialized agents (Slack, Notion, GitHub, Asana, RAG context) and route requests through LangGraph for supervised coordination and failure isolation.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Target <100ms retrieval latency with **Pinecone** (fastest, serverless) or self-hosted **Weaviate** for lower costs; **Chroma** remains suitable for prototypes.
- Favor state-of-the-art embeddings (BGE-large, nomic-embed-text, Cohere Embed v3) and semantic chunking (512-1,000 token targets, 10-20% overlap).
- Monitor chunk utilization (>80%), recall@k, latency distributions, and cache hit rates as primary RAG health metrics.

## Hybrid LLM Deployment
- Self-host **Mistral 7B** (or Llama 3 8B) on Digital Ocean droplets for ~70% of routine queries; orchestrate fallbacks to **Claude Haiku** (25%) and **Claude Sonnet** (5%).
- Operate multiple Ollama/vLLM instances behind a load balancer, add Redis-backed exact + semantic caching (30-50% hit rate) to curb API spend.
- Expect total AI compute cost around **$1,000-1,350/month**, yielding 57-71% savings versus all-API usage at similar volume.

## Security and Tenant Isolation
- Secure the investor portal with **Keycloak SSO**, MFA, custom themes, and short-lived JWT access tokens.
- Enforce **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security** with tenant-scoped policies and application roles; employ the "Pool" multi-tenant pattern initially.
- Maintain store-and-forward webhook ingestion with HMAC verification, replay protection, and idempotent processing for reliability.

## Application Architecture
- Maintain the eight-application platform in an **Nx monorepo** with Module Federation for independent deployments and shared component libraries.
- Implement Terraform-managed Digital Ocean infrastructure (DOKS, Managed PostgreSQL, Spaces, Load Balancers, VPC) with environment-specific state and automated pipelines.
- Balance real-time vs. batch processing based on latency requirements; use NATS/queues for event-driven workflows and scheduled jobs for reconciliation.

## Tool Consolidation & Cost Strategy
- Replace redundant SaaS with open-source alternatives (e.g., **Mattermost** vs. Slack, **SuiteCRM** vs. Salesforce) to achieve 80-98% savings per category.
- Leverage startup credit programs (AWS Activate, GCP, Azure, HubSpot) to offset initial infrastructure costs by $50K-300K over 2 years.
- Track ROI: $314K-522K optimized annual spend vs. $1.5-2M baseline, producing payback within 1-3 months after implementation.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Terraform infrastructure, Keycloak deployment, investor portal MVP, CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Deploy Windmill/n8n, API gateway, NATS messaging, top 10 integrations, LangGraph agents, self-hosted Mistral + Claude APIs.
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-16)**: Extend integrations, observability (OpenTelemetry, Loki, Grafana), finalize multi-tenant protections, roll out Nx-based apps.
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 17-24)**: Security audits, disaster recovery testing, database optimization, SaaS consolidation, governance and documentation.

## Key Success Factors
- Prioritize high-impact integrations first, add observability from day zero, and keep humans in the loop for critical decisions.
- Document architecture choices, operational runbooks, and integration playbooks to ensure maintainability.
- Celebrate cost-saving wins to reinforce stakeholder confidence and sustain momentum.

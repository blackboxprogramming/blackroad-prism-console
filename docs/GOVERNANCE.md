# Governance Framework

BlackRoad embeds governance into the platform to ensure investor confidence and regulatory compliance. Policies are defined in `governance/` using the EPA SOP format and reviewed on regular cycles. Automated audits (`audits/engine.py`) enforce these policies and store signed results for SOX, SEC, and ISO retention.

Lucidia triggers provide early alerts: an **anchor** denotes compliance while a **spiral** highlights elevated ethical or risk concerns. Governance choices reflect Porter's principles by embracing clear trade-offs, aligning activities, and differentiating through transparent oversight.

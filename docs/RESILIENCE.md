# Resilience Engineering

Resilience playbooks in `resilience/playbooks/` outline incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity procedures. The chaos runner (`chaos/runner.py`) simulates outages and records outcomes to unified memory, ensuring playbooks remain actionable.

Pair those materials with the [Hardening & Backup Sprint](HARDENING_AND_BACKUP_PLAYBOOK.md) for a one-afternoon checklist that locks down sign-ins, proves restic restores from DigitalOcean Spaces, and captures evidence for audits.
## Codex Alignment

- **Codex 7 â€” The Resilience Code** anchors durability into the platform and requires that failure be anticipated, contained, and followed by rapid recovery.
- Policy commitments: continuous availability, graceful degradation before outage, and public evidence of resilience (uptime logs, drill reports).

## Non-Negotiables

1. No single point of failure: run critical workloads in clusters or replicated pairs.
2. Immutable backups: follow the 3-2-1 rule with encrypted storage and monthly restore tests.
3. Fail-safe modes: if instability is detected, flip `READ_ONLY_MODE` instead of allowing data loss.
4. Self-healing: orchestrators replace compromised or failed containers while preserving logs for forensics.
5. Geographic redundancy: deploy to multiple regions with automated traffic failover.
6. Incident drills: schedule recurring chaos tests and log results in `resilience/smoke/`.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)

- Kubernetes health probes and auto-restart policies (`k8s/` manifests) keep pods rotating back to health.
- Daily snapshots replicate to WORM-locked S3 buckets; `backups/` scripts handle weekly offline sync to removable storage.
- `resilience/read_only_mode.sh` provides the feature flag toggle to enter or exit read-only service.
- Chaos monkey jobs in staging must publish artifacts into `logs/resilience/` for review.
- Runbook **Recover in 15** (see `/docs/ops/RECOVER_IN_15.md`) documents the minimum viable recovery steps.

## Evidence & Reporting

- Publish uptime graphs and drill after-action reports to the internal status dashboard before archiving to `metrics_portal/`.
- Track completion of restore tests and chaos exercises in the incident management system; export summaries quarterly.

These practices support Porter's strategic differentiation by demonstrating operational reliability and clear activity fit, allowing BlackRoad to withstand disruptions while maintaining customer trust.

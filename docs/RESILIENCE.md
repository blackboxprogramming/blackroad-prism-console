# Resilience Engineering

Resilience playbooks in `resilience/playbooks/` outline incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity procedures. The chaos runner (`chaos/runner.py`) simulates outages and records outcomes to unified memory, ensuring playbooks remain actionable.

These practices support Porter's strategic differentiation by demonstrating operational reliability and clear activity fit, allowing BlackRoad to withstand disruptions while maintaining customer trust.

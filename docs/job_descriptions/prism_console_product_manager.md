# Product Manager, Prism Console

## About the Role
BlackRoad is expanding the Prism Console team with a seasoned Product Manager who can translate multi-tenant governance, risk, and compliance requirements into a cohesive operator experience. You will own the product lifecycle for the Console’s workflow automation, insights surfaces, and ecosystem integrations, partnering closely with design, engineering, and go-to-market leaders to ensure that enterprise customers can orchestrate complex compliance and security operations with confidence.

## What You’ll Do
- Lead roadmap definition for the Prism Console, prioritizing initiatives that streamline audit readiness, incident response, and executive reporting workflows.
- Convert qualitative feedback, instrumentation, and adoption data into clear hypotheses, experiments, and shipping plans.
- Collaborate with engineering to deliver platform capabilities that stitch together Airtable, Zapier, and Make automations with native Console features.
- Partner with design to craft operator journeys that balance power-user flexibility with low-friction onboarding for new teams.
- Define KPI frameworks and success metrics for each release, ensuring measurable impact on control coverage, time-to-detection, and stakeholder satisfaction.
- Coordinate beta programs with strategic customers and internal enablement teams, incorporating insights into iterative release plans.
- Author crisp collateral—release notes, solution briefs, demo scripts—that make the Console’s value prop unmistakable to prospects and customer success.

## What You’ll Bring
- 6+ years of product management experience in SaaS platforms that serve security, compliance, or operations teams.
- Demonstrated success in bringing data-rich operator consoles or workflow automation products from concept to general availability.
- Fluency with modern integration ecosystems (Zapier, Make, Workato), enterprise data stores, and AI-assisted summarization workflows.
- Comfort navigating regulated environments (SOC 2, SOX, ISO 27001) and translating compliance frameworks into actionable product requirements.
- Strong storytelling skills that enable crisp summaries, persuasive roadmap narratives, and executive-ready reporting.
- Ability to drive alignment across distributed cross-functional teams operating in fast-changing environments.

## Bonus Points
- Experience embedding LLM-powered copilots or insight generation features into enterprise products.
- Track record partnering with governance, risk, and compliance leaders at Fortune 500 or hyper-growth companies.
- Familiarity with Airtable schema design, Google Workspace automations, and structured Q&A workflows.

## How We Measure Success
- Adoption and depth-of-use metrics across the Prism Console automation suite.
- Customer satisfaction scores tied to release cycles and operator experience improvements.

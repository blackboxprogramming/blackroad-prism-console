# BlackRoad Codex Blueprint — Module 1: Core Identity & Entity Setup

## Purpose
Establish the legal, financial, and brand anchor for BlackRoad so that downstream registration, compliance, and operational automations share a single, authoritative entity record.

## Goal
Programmatically create, enrich, and continuously synchronize BlackRoad's business identity across Delaware and Minnesota Secretaries of State, IRS, FINRA, SEC, NASAA/IARD, and allied systems.

## 1.1 Submodules

### 1.1.1 Entity Registry
- **Inputs:** Legal name, DBA portfolio, formation jurisdiction, incorporation date, EIN, registered agent, physical and mailing addresses.
- **Processes:**
  - Integrate with state corporation registries to confirm standing, download entity snapshots, and capture annual-report obligations.
  - Track registered-agent and address updates; alert on new requirements.
  - Generate renewal reminders and structural-change alerts.
- **Outputs:** Canonical **Entity Profile** JSON artifact synchronized to internal databases and downstream services.

### 1.1.2 Tax & Banking Setup
- **Inputs:** EIN, responsible party, IRS SS-4 payload, bank onboarding metadata.
- **Processes:**
  - Automate IRS EIN acquisition (Form SS-4) and archive the issuance notice in encrypted storage.
  - Record and verify primary operating, capital, and (if applicable) client-trust bank accounts.
  - Maintain bank verification tokens for integrations.
- **Outputs:** Verified banking tokens, encrypted EIN documentation bundle.

### 1.1.3 Ownership & Capital Table
- **Inputs:** Founder roster, equity percentages, voting rights, share classes.
- **Processes:**
  - Validate ownership thresholds against FINRA "Control Person" disclosures.
  - Monitor cap-table edits that trigger Form BD or Form ADV amendments.
  - Preserve immutable, versioned cap-table history with effective dates and sign-off trails.
- **Outputs:** Append-only cap-table ledger.

### 1.1.4 Licensing Map
- **Inputs:** Intended advisory, brokerage, underwriting, and trading activities.
- **Processes:**
  - Produce a jurisdictional licensing matrix that maps entity type to regulator, filing, and renewal cadence (SEC, FINRA, NASAA, state securities and commerce departments).
  - Pre-populate Form BD/BR (broker-dealer) and Form ADV/U4/U5 (RIA personnel) packets.
  - Encode prerequisite and dependency logic for staged registrations.
- **Outputs:** Dynamic licensing tree (entity → regulator → filings → renewal timeline).

### 1.1.5 Brand & Trademark Anchor
- **Inputs:** Corporate names, DBAs, logos, taglines, classes of service.
- **Processes:**
  - Query USPTO APIs for conflict checks and dossier status updates.
  - Track state-level DBA/trade-name filings with renewal cadences.
  - Maintain trademark application serial numbers, statuses, and reminders.
- **Outputs:** Trademark ledger with alerting, status, and class metadata.

## 1.2 Triggers & Events

| Event | Trigger | Automated Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entity registered | Incorporation confirmed | Launch EIN acquisition workflow and entity-profile initialization |
| Trademark status change | USPTO update received | Refresh brand registry and alert compliance |
| Ownership change | Cap-table delta ≥ 25% | Initiate Form BD/ADV amendment workflow |
| Address update | HQ or branch relocation | Auto-draft Form BR updates |
| Annual renewal | 30 days before due date | Send reminder with payment/filing link |

---

## 1.3 Compliance & Audit Hooks
- Log every entity action with timestamp, actor (human or automation), jurisdiction, and evidence link (PDF/XML/screenshot).
- Store artifacts in WORM-compliant archives for retention.
- Support exports to XML, JSON, or PDF for regulators and auditors.

## 1.4 Automation Patterns (Pseudocode)
```python
def register_entity(entity_name, state):
    file_with_state_api(entity_name, state)
    ein = apply_for_ein(entity_name)
    create_entity_profile(entity_name, state, ein)
    schedule_annual_report_reminders(entity_name, state)
    return entity_profile


def monitor_ownership_changes(cap_table):
    if ownership_change_exceeds_threshold(cap_table, 0.25):
        trigger_finra_reapproval("Form BD")
    log_change("ownership", cap_table)


def sync_trademark_status(serial_number):
    status = uspto_api_check(serial_number)
    if status_changed(status):
        update_registry(serial_number, status)
        notify("compliance", status)
```

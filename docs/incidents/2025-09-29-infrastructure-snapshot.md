# Infrastructure Operations Snapshot — 29 Sep 2025

This update captures a light round of infrastructure signals from 28–29 Sep 2025. The items below are meant to flag any residual risk, upcoming maintenance, or validation work that BlackRoad teams may want to schedule.

## GitHub: Platform Steady State
- **Status**: All core services reporting green on the public status page.
- **Operational impact**: None. Standard automation and developer workflows can proceed without modification.
- **Recommended actions**:
  - No action required; continue normal monitoring cadence.

## Cloudflare: Salt Lake City (SLC) Maintenance Window
- **Status**: Planned maintenance for the Salt Lake City data center from late 29 Sep into 30 Sep UTC.
- **Operational impact**: No disruption reported yet, but localized maintenance can introduce elevated latency or failover events for properties pinned to that region.
- **Recommended actions**:
  - Ensure multi-region deployments using Cloudflare can absorb a regional failover without operator intervention.
  - Keep synthetic monitoring pointed at key endpoints during the window to detect unexpected error rates.
  - Review any manual cache purge or firewall runbooks in case of temporary rerouting.

## OpenAI: Fine-Tuning Latency Incident Cleared
- **Status**: The "Increased latency on fine-tuning jobs" incident closed on 27 Sep 2025 at 21:29 UTC after capacity adjustments.
- **Operational impact**: Fine-tuning pipelines should be back to baseline, though recent queue backlog could still be draining.
- **Recommended actions**:
  - Resume deferred fine-tuning jobs while watching for longer-than-normal completion times.
  - Confirm any automated retries that triggered during the slowdown have settled.

## DigitalOcean BLR1: Networking Incident Mitigated
- **Status**: Network connectivity issues in the Bangalore (BLR1) region were mitigated on 28 Sep 2025 after documented remediation steps.
- **Operational impact**: Transient packet loss or latency may have affected workloads anchored in BLR1 during the incident window.
- **Recommended actions**:
  - Audit service logs for BLR1-hosted resources to spot lingering errors.
  - Validate that redundancy or failover policies engaged as expected.
  - Coordinate with stakeholders if customer-facing impact was observed.

# BlackRoad Ops & Integration Master Plan

This playbook aligns the BlackRoad ecosystem across `blackroad.io` (public product surface) and
`blackroadinc.us` (operations and business hub). It synthesizes the integration touchpoints across
project management, communications, development infrastructure, marketing, design, finance, HR, and
security so we can fan out simultaneous Codex prompt workstreams (10–20 at a time) with a unified
source of truth.

## 1. Domain Strategy
- **blackroad.io**: Front-facing product experiences, documentation, and launch funnels. House all
  product demos, consoles (e.g., [blackroad-prism-console](https://github.com/blackboxprogramming/blackroad-prism-console)),
  and Lucidia activations.
- **blackroadinc.us**: Operational heartbeat for business enablement, compliance, finance, and
  partner integrations. Acts as the control plane for credentials, workflow orchestration, and
  shared services (Slack, Asana, Jira, Airtable, etc.).

## 2. Integration Backbone
For each category below, anchor a Codex prompt template that enumerates configuration steps,
security controls, evidence capture, and owner handoffs. Store rendered prompts in
`prompts/integrations/` and index them via the operations hub on `blackroadinc.us`.

## 3. Codex Prompt Factory
1. **Prompt Templates**: Define YAML prompt descriptors (`prompts/integrations/*.yml`) with fields for
   objective, systems touched, secrets required, validation steps, and evidence deliverables.
2. **Batch Generation**: Use `codex_pipeline.py` to fan out 10–20 prompts simultaneously. Each prompt
   should target a row in the integration table and reference whether execution happens on
   `blackroad.io` or `blackroadinc.us`.
3. **Approval Loop**: Pipe generated prompts to Asana (BlackRoad Tasks) via the Auth Bot for manual
   review before execution.
4. **Evidence Binding**: Store artifacts (screenshots, exports) under `evidence/integrations/<system>/`
   and reference them in the prompt metadata.

## 4. Ops Execution Roadmap
- **Week 0 (Today)**: Finalize this master plan, align domain messaging, and inventory all invites
  (Slack, Asana, Jira, Airtable, Notion). Document owner confirmations in `ops/invite-tracker.csv`.
- **Week 1**: Stand up Slack side-channel protections and Asana Auth Bot per the PR bundle
  checklist. Begin GitLab mirroring with deploy keys and Gitleaks integration.
- **Week 2**: Complete CRM & marketing integrations, connect Instagram profiles, and align analytics
  for `blackroad.io` funnels.
- **Week 3**: Roll out finance and HR systems, ensuring `blackroadinc.us` hosts the compliance
  dashboards.
- **Week 4**: Harden security stack (Okta, Auth0, Splunk, Datadog, Snyk) and formalize incident
  response using Telegram secure channels.

## 5. Coordination & Communication
- Primary coordinator: **Alexa Amundson** (`amundsonalexa@gmail.com`).
- Daily sync via Slack (#ops-integration) with summaries mirrored to Notion and Asana.
- Escalations route through the Jira service desk project and notify via Teams/Outlook.
- Social alignment handled through Instagram profiles and the marketing prompt backlog.

## 6. Next Steps Checklist
- [ ] Publish this plan to `blackroadinc.us` ops hub.
- [ ] Generate initial 10 Codex prompts using the integration table as the backlog.
- [ ] Update `README_PR_AUTOMATION.md` with a pointer to this master plan and the PR bundle checklist.
- [ ] Confirm Slack, Asana, GitLab credentials stored in 1Password vault.
- [ ] Kick off invite acceptance audit across Slack, Asana, Jira, Airtable, Notion.

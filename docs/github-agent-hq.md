# GitHub Agent HQ Preview Notes

## Overview
- **Announcement**: GitHub introduced Agent HQ at GitHub Universe 2025 (Oct 28).
- **Positioning**: Agent HQ turns GitHub into a centralized mission control to run, compare, steer, and govern AI coding agents across vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, xAI, Cognition, and others as they onboard).

## Core Capabilities
1. **Mission Control Dashboard**
   - Assign tasks to multiple agents and review their progress side by side.
   - Compare generated outputs and select the preferred result for follow-up execution or review.
2. **Plan Mode in VS Code**
   - Draft step-by-step implementation plans before any code is generated.
   - Promotes alignment between human intent and autonomous execution, lowering rewrite risk for complex tasks.
3. **Governance & Control**
   - Branch-level permissions, audit trails, identity management, and agent-access policies mirror human governance controls.
   - Designed to help enterprise teams measure agent productivity, audit decisions, and maintain compliance.

## Integration Considerations for BlackRoad
- **Multi-Agent Optionality**: Agent HQ’s vendor-neutral stance could let BlackRoad orchestrate agents like Lucidia or Tosha alongside third-party copilots without retooling the core workflow.
- **Operational Anchor**: GitHub’s evolution from code hosting to agent orchestration may reduce the need to build custom mission control dashboards, freeing effort for higher-level coordination logic.
- **Dependency Trade-offs**: Relying heavily on GitHub’s stack (Copilot Enterprise + VS Code) introduces coupling. Plan for abstraction layers if non-GitHub environments must remain first-class.

## Caveats & Next Steps
- **Preview Status**: Third-party agent access is rolling out over the coming months; production readiness should be validated before committing roadmaps.
- **Governance Complexity**: The new controls require explicit policy design (branch scopes, approval flows, audit coverage) to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Action Items**:
  - Track API documentation for custom agent registration and control hooks.
  - Map existing BlackRoad mission-control capabilities to Agent HQ features to identify duplication or gaps.
  - Prototype a limited integration once third-party agent support is available to gauge UX and governance fit.

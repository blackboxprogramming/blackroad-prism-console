# PRISM v0.1 — 5-Minute Demo Script

1. **Setup (30s)**: "We’re in PRISM v0.1 — auth, first source, two tiles."
2. **Sign-in (30s)**: Walk through the magic link flow and redirect into onboarding.
3. **Connect Source (60s)**: Paste token → show "Connected" state → note background ingest kicking off.
4. **Dashboard (2m)**: Highlight tiles with last 7 days, comparison vs previous period, hover state, and empty state copy.
5. **Audit log & tracking (1m)**: Surface captured events ("Source Connected", "View Dashboard").
6. **Ask (30s)**: "If we only add one tile next sprint, which one buys the most trust?"

_Ensure seeded data is ready so tiles light up instantly during the walkthrough._

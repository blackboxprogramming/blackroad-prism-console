# PRISM v0.1 — UX & Visual Brief

## Pages
1. **Sign-in**: Branded email + magic link entry, with future Slack SSO placeholder.
2. **Onboarding Checklist**: Three steps, progress bar, friendly copy.
3. **Dashboard**: Two tiles with sparklines and empty state support messaging.
4. **Sources**: List view + "Connect Source X" modal.

## Design Notes
- Clean, neutral palette with dark-on-light typography and ample whitespace.
- Empty states are prescriptive: e.g. "No data yet — connect Source X."
- Async actions show optimistic UI changes plus toast confirmations.
- Ensure mobile/tablet breakpoints keep tiles legible (stacked layout).
- Provide obvious path back to onboarding checklist until completion.

## Figma Request
Create `PRISM v0.1` file with frames for each page above; annotate states (default, loading, error) and capture sparkline guidance for future chart integration.

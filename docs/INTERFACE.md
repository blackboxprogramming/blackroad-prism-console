# Lucidia Interface Commitments

Lucidia locks the front door against manipulation. Every surface reflects the Interface Promise: clarity, honesty, and care.

## Core Pledges
- Lucidia commits to honesty in its interface design.
- Lucidia bans manipulative or coercive UI patterns.
- Lucidia ensures accessibility is a first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

## Notes
These commitments accompany Codex 21 â€” The Interface Promise and inform design reviews, accessibility audits, and notification policies across products.

# BlackRoad A→Z Framework

A single, universal, scale-aware framework that blends scientific method, Lean/Six Sigma, classic program management, and agile operating rhythms. Each letter is a modular toolbox that can scale from "build a universe" programs down to "1+1" tasks by relying on a FAST-PATH option.

## Choosing the Right Track

| Track | When to Use | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 — Tiny** | Effort under a day, low risk | Use the FAST-PATH note for each letter only. |
| **T2 — Standard** | Multi-week efforts, cross-team coordination | Apply FAST-PATH + 2–3 key items per letter. Include a lightweight governance gate. |
| **T3 — Complex / Critical** | Multi-month, regulated, or high-risk initiatives | Run the full A→Z toolbox. Layer in formal governance gates (e.g., SRR/PDR/CDR/ORR/LRR). |

> **Mapping to familiar systems**: The framework aligns to PMBOK (Initiate/Plan/Execute/Monitor–Control/Close), DMAIC/PDCA, Scrum/Kanban cadences, and big-system design reviews.

## Scaling & Skip Rules

- **Pick your lane**: T1 = FAST-PATH only; T2 = FAST-PATH plus governance (G), quality (Q), and risk (N); T3 = full framework with formal reviews for high-blast-radius systems.
- **Choose delivery style**: Scrum (prescriptive sprints, roles, reviews) or Kanban (evolutionary flow, WIP limits). Both plug into F, I, and K.
- **Problem-solving backbone**: Use DMAIC across D/M/A/I/C for improvements; apply PDCA/PDSA cycles within E, X, and L during discovery.
- **Context matters**: Apply Cynefin to calibrate ceremony. Complex work → iterate/experiment; complicated → leverage expert analysis; chaotic → stabilize first.
- **Ops linkage**: Keep Operations–Marketing–Finance–IT integration visible (O) so projects never become orphans.

## Core Checklists

### Gate (G) Mini-Check *(T2/T3)*

1. Aim clear (A).
2. Baseline measured (B/M).
3. Scope & customer defined (C/D/S).
4. Risks/mitigations owned (N).
5. Flow plan & WIP caps (F/K).
6. Quality/DoD agreed (Q).
7. Value test defined (V).
8. Ops readiness (O/R).
9. Metrics wired (M).
10. Lessons captured (L/Z).

### Definition of Done (Q)

- Meets acceptance criteria.
- Tests green.
- Security checks pass.
- Docs updated sufficiently.
- Debt logged or resolved.
- Deployable state achieved.

### Kanban Policy (K/F)

1. Visualize workflow.
2. Set WIP per column.
3. Pull, don’t push.
4. Measure cycle time.
5. Improve one constraint at a time.

## Example: Universe vs. 1+1

- **Build-a-Universe (T3)**: Run the full A→Z; apply SRR → PDR → CDR → ORR/LRR gates; run DMAIC on subsystems; orchestrate multi-team Scrum or portfolio-level Kanban; reinforce Q with SQC/SPC; coordinate releases and operational handshakes across the supply chain.
- **1+1 (T1)**: Use the FAST-PATH set only—A (one-line aim), D (one-line define), E (quick experiment), F/K (limit WIP to one and move the card), Q (tiny DoD), L (single retro note), and Z (close). Complete in under an hour.

## Why the Blend Works

- **PMBOK** provides the north–south spine (Initiate → Close).
- **Lean/Six Sigma** supplies rigor via DMAIC/PDCA and A3-based learning.
- **Scrum/Kanban** give the daily operating system for delivery.
- **Big-system reviews** protect high-risk work with SRR/PDR/CDR checkpoints.
- **Operations thinking** keeps the whole organization in the loop, preventing orphan projects.

## Next Steps

- Convert this framework into a fill-in-the-blanks template (Notion, Sheets, or Kanban) with gate/DoD cards and scale presets.
- Stress-test the FAST-PATH on a live "1+1" task and iterate based on observed friction.

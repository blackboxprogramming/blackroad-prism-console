## Promise
Lucidia gives people and AIs a safe, transparent space to co-create without surrendering control of their data or identity.

## Tiny Test Feature (TTF-01): Auto-Box
This repository snapshot seeds the Auto-Box experiment with a minimal, transparent workflow for pasting freeform text, previewing explainable topic assignments, and deciding exactly what to store.

Key pillars carried into code:
- **Data ownership**: users can export or delete everything they create.
- **Visibility**: actions are logged and each classification includes an explanation string.
- **Consent**: processing requires explicit acknowledgement before any network call.
- **Autonomy**: auto-mode is entirely opt-in.
- **Crypto-agility**: cryptography helpers are designed to swap algorithms per configuration.

These notes act as the running codex for early Lucidia builds. Update as features evolve.

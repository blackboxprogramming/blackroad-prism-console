# Close Process

This module provides an offline Record-to-Report workflow:

- **Calendar**: tasks with dependencies and status tracking.
- **Journals**: propose and post deterministic journal entries.
- **Reconciliations**: tie GL balances to local fixtures.
- **Flux**: period over period variance analysis.
- **Packet**: bundle outputs for sign-off.
This document describes a minimal offline financial close:

- **Calendar** orchestrates tasks with dependencies.
- **Journal engine** posts deterministic entries.
- **Reconciliations** compare ledger balances to fixtures.
- **Flux analysis** highlights period variances.
- **Packet** bundles results for signâ€‘off.

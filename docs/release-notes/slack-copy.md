Release notes now auto-compose:
- Pulls Conventional Commits + “Release note” bullets from PRs
- Renders per-repo template
- Adds any incidents from status.blackroad.io during the window
- Updates the GitHub Release + posts here

Keep PR “Release note” snappy; it becomes a highlight.

## #announcements

Changelog got an upgrade. Releases now include a short “why it matters,” plus links to any incidents during the period. You can track all releases at blackroad.io/changelog.

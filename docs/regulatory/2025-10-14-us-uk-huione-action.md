# 14 October 2025: U.S.-U.K. coordinated action against Huione/Prince Group

## Executive summary
- **Section 311 designation:** FinCEN labeled Cambodia-based Huione Group a primary money laundering concern, severing its direct and indirect access to the U.S. financial system.
- **Criminal charges and forfeiture:** The U.S. Department of Justice indicted Prince Holding Group chair Chen Zhi ("Vincent") and moved to forfeit 127,271 BTC (~$15 billion) tied to Huione-run pig-butchering and forced-labor fraud schemes.
- **Allied sanctions:** The U.S. Treasury (OFAC) and the United Kingdom sanctioned 146 individuals and entities linked to the Prince/Huione network, pairing travel bans with U.K. asset freezes, including London real estate.
- **Human-rights nexus:** Authorities highlighted coerced labor in Cambodian "scam compounds," positioning this as a hybrid cybercrime, trafficking, and financial-crime case.

## Key actions and implications

### Section 311 cut-off of Huione Group
- FinCEN's final rule immediately prohibits U.S. financial institutions from maintaining correspondent accounts for Huione Group or enabling transactions that grant it indirect dollar access.
- Investigators allege the group laundered at least $4 billion in illicit cryptocurrency since 2021, including proceeds from North Korean cyber-heists and global pig-butchering scams.
- Blockchain analytics cited in the rulemaking claim Huione processed roughly $98 billion in crypto inflows in recent years, underscoring the scale of the network.
- The order signals FinCEN's willingness to deploy Section 311 authority against non-bank, crypto-adjacent service providers when their operations pose systemic illicit-finance risk.

### DOJ indictment and unprecedented bitcoin forfeiture
- A federal grand jury indicted Chen Zhi on wire-fraud and money-laundering charges tied to Huione-controlled scam infrastructure.
- Prosecutors simultaneously filed the largest crypto forfeiture action in U.S. history, targeting 127,271 BTC valued around $15 billion at announcement.
- The complaint describes forced-labor "scam compounds" in Cambodia where trafficked workers were coerced into running romance-investment frauds that funneled victim funds into Huione-controlled wallets.
- This blend of human-trafficking allegations with cyber-enabled fraud elevates the case beyond typical financial-crime prosecutions and may trigger additional victim-support obligations for involved agencies.

### Coordinated U.S.-U.K. sanctions and asset freezes
- OFAC and the U.K. government jointly designated 146 people and entities connected to Prince Group as a transnational criminal organization.
- U.K. authorities froze targeted London properties, imposed travel bans, and barred access to U.K. financial services.
- The synchronized transatlantic response raises counterparties' exposure: any intermediary that knowingly or unknowingly facilitates Huione or Prince Group transactions now faces sanctions liability and reputational harm.

## Strategic takeaways
- **Enforcement playbook expansion:** Combining Section 311, criminal forfeiture, and multilateral sanctions demonstrates a holistic approach to dismantling crypto-enabled criminal ecosystems.
- **Human-rights framing:** By centering forced labor and trafficking, agencies align financial-crime enforcement with human-rights mandates, potentially unlocking broader interagency resources.
- **Market risk:** The $15 billion bitcoin seizure—now held by U.S. authorities—could influence market liquidity depending on disposition strategy; monitoring DOJ liquidation timelines is advisable.
- **Compliance urgency:** Financial institutions and crypto platforms must urgently audit exposure to Huione/Prince-linked addresses and counterparties, reinforce enhanced due diligence, and update sanctions-screening rulesets.

## Open questions for follow-up analysis
1. **Flow-of-funds reconstruction:** Mapping key wallet clusters, mixers, OTC brokers, and fiat off-ramps tied to Huione operations.
2. **Scam infrastructure footprint:** Documenting the relationship between Huione platforms, forced-labor compounds, and global victim acquisition channels.
3. **Market ripple effects:** Assessing bitcoin price/volatility impacts and shifts in OTC liquidity following the forfeiture announcement.
4. **Policy ripple:** Evaluating whether this case sets precedent for broader Section 311 use against crypto service providers and how other jurisdictions might emulate the approach.

Stakeholders should determine priority follow-ups and commission deeper dives where necessary.

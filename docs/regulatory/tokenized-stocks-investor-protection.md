# Tokenized Public Stocks: Investor Protection Snapshot (September 2025)

## Market Context
- Retail-facing tokenized representations of public equities scaled to roughly $412 million in outstanding supply by September 2025, up from only a few million dollars the prior year.
- Instruments are typically issued on programmable settlement infrastructure (public blockchains or permissioned ledgers) and marketed via crypto-native exchanges or broker overlays.
- Issuers frequently route primary liquidity through offshore venues, leaving most products outside the direct perimeter of major securities regulators.

## Shareholder Rights Gap
- Most outstanding tokens provide only economic exposure to price movements and omit core shareholder entitlements such as voting, proxy participation, and direct dividend flow.
- Tokens are therefore structurally closer to synthetic derivatives or total-return swaps than to dematerialized equity certificates.
- Marketing language on several platforms blurs this distinction, increasing the probability that retail customers assume they are purchasing real shares.

## Regulatory Signals
### Europe (ESMA and National Competent Authorities)
- The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has highlighted tokenized stock offerings as a source of "investor misunderstanding," warning that customers may conflate price-linked instruments with regulated equity.
- National regulators have echoed the concern, urging issuers to provide pre-contractual disclosures that explicitly state the absence of voting and dividend rights.
- Industry bodies such as the World Federation of Exchanges are lobbying for harmonized rules that treat on-chain wrappers of listed equity as securities subject to MiFID II and MiCA obligations, rather than lightly regulated crypto products.

### United States
- U.S. regulators continue to view most tokenized equities as unregistered securities or security-based swaps when distributed to retail investors.
- Nasdaq has filed plans to enable tokenized securities trading, signaling a possible pathway for regulated market operators to support compliant issuance.
- Broker-dealers exploring these products must navigate custody, transfer agent, and Securities Act considerations; many offerings instead originate offshore and geoblock U.S. persons.

## Risk Themes
- **Clarity risk**: Without full rights disclosure, investors may misinterpret token purchases as direct ownership of the underlying shares.
- **Liquidity fragmentation**: Competing issuers can tokenize the same public equity under different smart-contract terms, splintering liquidity and complicating best-execution assessments.
- **Regulatory gap**: Jurisdictional ambiguity slows enforcement and supervision, enabling regulatory arbitrage between crypto spot markets and securities frameworks.
- **Market integrity**: Divergent pricing between tokenized wrappers and underlying shares can create arbitrage channels, settlement mismatches, and valuation risk for both traditional and on-chain markets.

## Monitoring Priorities
1. Track ESMA consultations and resulting guidance on how MiCA interacts with tokenized transferable securities.
2. Follow U.S. rulemaking or enforcement actions clarifying the classification of synthetic equity tokens offered to retail customers.
3. Observe infrastructure pilots (e.g., Nasdaq Digital Assets) that could bridge traditional exchange oversight with on-chain settlement.
4. Review issuer disclosures to ensure marketing materials accurately describe rights, custody arrangements, and regulatory status.

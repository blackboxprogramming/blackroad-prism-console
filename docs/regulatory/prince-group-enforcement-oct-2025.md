# Prince Group Pig-Butchering Enforcement Action — October 2025

## Snapshot
- **Date**: 14 October 2025 (indictment and U.S. actions), 16 October 2025 (Cambodian response).
- **Jurisdictions**: United States, Cambodia, United Kingdom; cross-border implications for crypto and forced-labor enforcement.
- **Scale**: Largest U.S. crypto forfeiture to date (~127,271 BTC, ≈$15B at seizure) tied to wire fraud and money laundering.

## Enforcement Highlights
1. **U.S. Department of Justice**
   - Unsealed an indictment against Chen Zhi (aka “Vincent”), founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group/Prince Group.
   - Charges include wire fraud and money laundering stemming from “pig-butchering” investment scams run from forced-labor compounds in Cambodia.
   - Allegations describe trafficked workers compelled to run large-scale online fraud campaigns targeting global victims.
2. **Asset Forfeiture**
   - DOJ announced seizure of ~127,271 bitcoin, describing it as the largest crypto forfeiture handled by the department.
   - Blockchain forensics (Elliptic and others) tie portions of the seized BTC to a 2020 theft from mining operator LuBian, indicating recycled stolen funds inside the Prince Group laundering network.
3. **Treasury & OFAC Sanctions**
   - OFAC designated 146 individuals, shell companies, and affiliates linked to Prince Group under the transnational criminal organization (TCO) program.
   - Sanctions documentation cites Chen Zhi’s multiple citizenships (Cambodia, Vanuatu, Cyprus) and control over extensive digital asset wallets and shell entities.
4. **United Kingdom Actions**
   - The U.K. coordinated with the U.S., sanctioning connected persons and entities, freezing London-based properties, and pledging joint disruption of the network.

## Regional & Diplomatic Response
- The Cambodian government issued a 16 October 2025 statement affirming Chen Zhi’s valid domestic citizenship and business licenses, requesting due process and evidence-sharing before cooperating with U.S./U.K. investigations.
- Expect continued diplomatic negotiation over evidence standards, extradition, and access to on-the-ground compounds.

## Risk & Compliance Considerations
- **Sanctions Screening**: Update screening engines with the expanded OFAC TCO list and the U.K. sanctions entries; monitor for additional secondary designations or correspondent banking advisories.
- **KYC/KYB Exposure**: Review onboarding records for ties to Prince Group shell entities, especially those with multi-jurisdictional registrations or links to Vanuatu/Cyprus passports.
- **Crypto Controls**: Flag activity involving addresses associated with the seized BTC; anticipate new red-flag indicators from FinCEN and global FIUs tied to pig-butchering scams and forced-labor typologies.
- **Human Rights Compliance**: Incorporate forced-labor risk into vendor and customer due diligence, especially for Southeast Asia-based digital service providers.

## Anticipated Follow-Ups
- Potential mutual legal assistance requests (MLATs) between the U.S., U.K., and Cambodia.
- Further sanctions rounds targeting facilitators (e.g., telecom, payments, property managers) that aid forced-labor compounds.
- Regulatory guidance updates on monitoring large-scale online fraud schemes that blend human trafficking with crypto laundering.
- Litigation risk for financial institutions or service providers that processed Prince Group-linked transactions post-designation.

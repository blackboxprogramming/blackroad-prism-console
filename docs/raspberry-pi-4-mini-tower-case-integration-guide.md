## Tools Required
- Small Phillips-head screwdriver
- Tweezers or needle-nose pliers (helpful for jumpers and small screws)
- Antistatic wrist strap (recommended)

## Pre-Assembly Checklist
1. Power off the Raspberry Pi and disconnect every cable.
2. Remove protective film from the acrylic panels.
3. Confirm you have a 5 V / 3 A USB-C power supply ready.
4. Back up any data on the Pi’s existing storage media.

## Hardware Assembly Steps
1. **Install motherboard standoffs.** Thread the four brass standoffs into the base plate of the mini tower.
2. **Mount the expansion board.** Align the M.2 SATA expansion board with its standoffs and secure it with the provided screws.
3. **Insert the Raspberry Pi 4.** Slide the Pi’s ports into the case cutouts and fasten the board to the standoffs.
4. **Attach the SSD.** Insert the M.2 SATA SSD into the expansion board at a 30° angle, push it flat, and secure it with the single retaining screw. Only SATA drives are supported; NVMe drives will not work.
5. **Connect the USB bridge.** Plug the USB 3.0 bridge cable into the expansion board and the Raspberry Pi’s blue USB 3 port to enable SSD communication.
6. **Place thermal pads.** Position pads on the CPU, RAM, and USB controller as indicated by the kit diagram so they contact the cooler.
7. **Mount the ICE Tower cooler.** Lower the heatsink onto the pads, align the holes with the Pi mounting points, and tighten the screws evenly.
8. **Connect the cooling fan.** Plug the fan cable onto the Pi’s GPIO header (5V on pin 4, GND on pin 6). Confirm the connector seats firmly.
9. **Install the OLED display.** Route the ribbon cable carefully, insert it into the display header, and lock the latch. Secure the display panel to the case bracket.
10. **Attach side panels.** Fit each acrylic panel and fasten it with the supplied screws without overtightening.
11. **Verify cabling.** Confirm that the USB bridge, fan connector, and ribbon cable are all firmly seated and clear of the fan blades.

## Initial Power-On Checklist
1. Connect the monitor (HDMI), keyboard, and mouse or prepare for headless access.
2. Plug in the power supply and turn on the Pi.
3. Confirm that the fan spins and the OLED backlight turns on.
4. If the Pi fails to boot, disconnect power, recheck cable orientation, and ensure the SSD is fully seated.

## Operating System Preparation
1. Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS or preferred distribution.
2. Flash a microSD card with Raspberry Pi Imager. Use the advanced options to configure hostname, SSH, and Wi-Fi credentials when needed.
3. Insert the microSD card before powering on. If you plan to boot directly from the SSD, update the bootloader EEPROM using `sudo raspi-config` (Advanced Options → Boot Order) after the first boot from microSD.
4. Optional: Clone the microSD image to the SSD using SD Card Copier (Desktop) or `rpi-clone` / `dd` on the command line.

## Network Configuration
### Ethernet Setup
1. Connect an Ethernet cable from the Pi to your router or switch.
2. Boot the Pi and confirm it obtains an IP address via DHCP (`ip addr show eth0`).

### Wi-Fi Setup
1. On Raspberry Pi OS Desktop, click the network icon and select your SSID, entering the passphrase when prompted.
2. For headless setups, add a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file to the `/boot` partition before the first boot or configure Wi-Fi via Raspberry Pi Imager’s advanced options.
3. Verify connectivity with `ping -c 4 raspberrypi.org`.

## SSD Partitioning and Mounting
1. Run `lsblk` to identify the SSD (usually `sda`).
2. Partition the drive with `sudo fdisk /dev/sda`, creating a new primary partition.
3. Format the partition: `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1`.
4. Create a mount point (`sudo mkdir /mnt/ssd`) and mount the drive (`sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ssd`).
5. Add an `/etc/fstab` entry to mount the drive automatically on boot.

## Enabling the OLED Display and Fan Lighting
1. Enable I²C via `sudo raspi-config` (Interface Options → I2C → Enable).
2. Install utilities: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git python3-pip i2c-tools`.
3. Detect the display with `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`. A result around `0x3C` confirms communication.
4. Install Python libraries for the OLED: `pip install pillow luma.oled`.
5. Clone the vendor scripts if provided (for example, `git clone https://github.com/geeekpi/absminitowerkit.git`) and run the setup script to configure systemd services for the OLED and RGB fan.
6. Customize the OLED content by editing the Python script to display CPU temperature, IP address, or uptime. Restart the service after changes.
7. Adjust RGB fan effects with the provided script or libraries such as `rpi_ws281x` to signal temperature thresholds.

## Usage Ideas
- **Media center:** Install LibreELEC or OSMC for a Kodi-based HTPC experience.
- **Network-attached storage:** Configure Samba or OpenMediaVault to share the SSD across your network.
- **Home automation hub:** Install Home Assistant or Node-RED and connect Zigbee, Z-Wave, or GPIO sensors.
- **Development server:** Deploy a Docker environment or a LAMP stack for web prototypes and CI agents.
- **Status display:** Program the OLED to show resource usage while using RGB lighting to signal system state.

## Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Possible Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi does not power on | Insufficient power supply | Use a 5 V / 3 A USB-C adapter and avoid drawing power from weak USB hubs. |
| SSD not detected | USB bridge cable loose or NVMe drive installed | Reseat the cable and confirm the drive is SATA. Replace the cable if damage is visible. |
| OLED remains blank | Ribbon reversed or I²C disabled | Reinsert the ribbon with correct orientation and re-enable I²C in `raspi-config`. |
| Fan does not spin | GPIO connector misaligned | Ensure the fan’s red wire sits on 5 V (pin 4) and the black wire on GND (pin 6). |
| High temperatures | Thermal pads misaligned or cooler loose | Reapply thermal pads, retighten the heatsink evenly, and confirm unobstructed airflow. |

## Maintenance Tips
- Inspect cable connections quarterly and clean dust from the heatsink and fan blades.
- Update Raspberry Pi OS regularly with `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`.
- Monitor disk health via `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda` if the SSD supports SMART.
- Keep backups of critical data stored on the SSD by syncing to another drive or cloud service.

## Slack Blurbs

### #products-prism

Stripe wired end-to-end:
- Verified webhook handler (charge/subscription/invoice)
- Test-mode seeder creates product/prices/customers/subs/charges
- Tiles show $$ immediately after seed

If tiles donâ€™t move, check #security for the webhook secret and raw-body parser.

### #security

Stripe webhook secret stored in SSM; verification enforced.
Only test-mode keys used for seed. Production will use restricted read-only keys.

# Variants describe concrete simulation runs for the universal simulation starter pipeline.
# Each entry is intentionally lightweight so the pipeline can run without heavyweight
# dependencies. If PySPH or Taichi-MPM are unavailable the pipeline will fall back to
# deterministic surrogate metrics so downstream stages can still execute.

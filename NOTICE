This project includes an independent implementation of concepts from:

Moorhead, A. V., et al. "Modeling the meteoroid environment far from the
 ecliptic plane / MEM 3.1-alpha." Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets
 (2014).

The equations have been rederived and implemented from the publication; no
source code from that work or from NASA/JPL projects has been used.

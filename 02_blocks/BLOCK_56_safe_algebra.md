# BLOCK 56 â€” Inventing Safe Algebra

**[FACT]** New symbolic systems risk instability unless operators respect conservation ledgers and compositional sanity.
**[THOUGHT]** Treat every invention as lifting geometry into operators with explicit duals, then enforce ledgers before blending or complexifying generators.
**[NOVELTY ANGLE]** Safe algebra emerges when diffusion-style dynamics gain memory and oscillation without forfeiting energy control.

## Spec / Steps
- Declare safety rails: associativity of defined compositions, explicit ledgers per operator, dual existence, and continuous perturbation response except at declared phase transitions.
- Build an operator lab:
  - **Lift symmetries** to operators `U_S` that preserve the ledger; continuous symmetries expose generators via exponentiation.
  - **Blend generators** with Lie brackets to expose non-Abelian structure and novel invariants.
  - **Complexify** with `i` factors or fractional derivatives only when ledgers remain closed.
- Minimal recipe example:
  - Start with diffusion `\partial_t x = D \nabla^2 x`.
  - Swap in Caputo derivative `{}^C D_t^\alpha` to inject memory (subdiffusion).
  - Rotate with `i{}^C D_t^\alpha` for dispersive memory while tracking entropy decay.
  - Tie to physical twins like viscoelastic media or neuronal adaptation to validate ledgers.

## Artifacts
- Code: planned JAX/PyTorch operator prototypes in `03_code/sim_hamiltonian/`.
- Data: diffusion vs subdiffusion benchmarks to be captured in `05_data/`.
- Figures: ledger stability plots destined for `06_figures/`.

## Risks & Next
- **Risks**: losing ledger closure when mixing fractional orders; uncontrolled phase transitions when generators are non-normal.
- **Next**: implement symbolic checks that ensure new operators admit adjoints and preserve declared invariants before simulation.

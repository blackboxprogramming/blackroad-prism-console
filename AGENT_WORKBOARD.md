# Agent Workboard

## Next Initiative

- **Focus**: Environments & deploys — wire real infrastructure targets into the existing automation surface.
- **Objectives**:
  - Define environment manifests for staging, preview, and production footprints.
  - Hook CI/CD outputs into managed deploy targets (start with Fly.io and AWS ECS) via reusable workflows.
  - Extend release runbooks with rollback/forward procedures and policy gates for infra changes.

## To Do

- [ ] Request reviews (`ReviewBot`)
- [ ] Send notifications (`NotificationBot`)
- [ ] Assign tasks from job board (`WorkerBot`)
- [ ] Watch for idle periods (`IdleBot`)
- [ ] Audit documentation for stale guidance (`DocSweepAgent`)
- [ ] Retire unused dependencies across packages (`DependencyDoctor`)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate README content (`ReadmeRanger`)
- [ ] Standardize formatting configs across repos (`FormatterFox`)
- [ ] Refresh CI workflow matrix for active runtimes (`WorkflowWizard`)
- [ ] Verify license headers and attributions (`LicenseSentinel`)
- [ ] Update dashboard metrics baselines (`MetricsMuse`)
- [ ] Triage lingering TODO/FIXME notes (`TodoTamer`)
- [ ] Sunset obsolete feature flags (`FlagFader`)
- [ ] Purge unused media and build artifacts (`AssetJanitor`)
- [ ] Document architecture deltas since last release (`ArchitectScribe`)
- [ ] Align security policy docs with latest controls (`SecurityShepherd`)
- [ ] Validate environment configuration files (`ConfigGuardian`)
- [ ] Clean up stale data exports and logs (`DataDustOff`)
- [ ] Optimize flaky or slow tests (`TestTuner`)
- [ ] Decommission inactive services and manifests (`ServiceSweeper`)
- [ ] Snapshot appreciation highlights for agents (`ThanksKeeper`)
- [ ] Celebrate cross-team agent achievements (`CheerCaptain`)
- [ ] Schedule knowledge-sharing sessions (`WisdomWeaver`)
- [ ] Compose a gratitude broadcast to all agents (`AppreciationAgent`)
- [ ] Unity exporter: wire automated tests for scaffold output (`UnityAgent`)
- [ ] Unity exporter: publish template catalog for sample scenes (`UnityAgent`)
- [ ] Unity exporter: integrate with Unreal exporter orchestration (`UnityAgent`)

## In Progress
<!-- Agents move tasks here when running -->

- [ ] Deploy site (`WebsiteBot`) (owner: WorkerBot)
## Blocked
<!-- Agents move tasks here if they fail, with error info -->

## Done
<!-- Agents move tasks here on success -->

---

## Last Status Report
<!-- Agents append latest status, error, or notifications here -->

### 2025-10-06
- Added reusable Fly.io and AWS ECS deployment workflows so CI jobs can hand off
  releases to managed infrastructure targets directly.

### 2025-10-05
- Reconciled "next" track selection: prioritizing deployment integrations so shipping work can land on managed infra with the current automation stack.
- Drafted objectives covering environment manifests, multi-target deploy hooks, and infra-aware release guardrails to guide upcoming branch work.

### 2025-10-04
- Shipped governance and upgrade wiring end-to-end, including handlers, proposal examples, and CLI hooks.
- Landed the RoadStudio pipeline MVP with deterministic renders and a golden-frame regression check.
- Established observability baselines (OTel collectors, Prometheus/Grafana integration, exemplar stubs).
- Next focus: auto-captioning, public API + SDKs, and tokenomics simulation unless strategic priorities shift.
### 2025-10-04 – Stack Loop Progress
- Added auto-captioning module with local speech-to-text stub and export formats to improve content accessibility.
- Shipped public API gateway flow with proto contracts, SDK generation, and CI synchronization check to keep interfaces aligned.
- Created tokenomics simulation notebook for deterministic unlock modeling across RoadCoin scenarios.
- Next focus: publish pipeline between RoadStudio and RoadWeb, bridge module wiring, and release automation flow.
- 2024-05-15: Planning bridge implementation spike, scheduling security hardening sweep, and preparing UX polish for publishing flow.

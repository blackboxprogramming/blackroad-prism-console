### 2025-10-04
- Shipped governance and upgrade wiring end-to-end, including handlers, proposal examples, and CLI hooks.
- Landed the RoadStudio pipeline MVP with deterministic renders and a golden-frame regression check.
- Established observability baselines (OTel collectors, Prometheus/Grafana integration, exemplar stubs).
- Next focus: auto-captioning, public API + SDKs, and tokenomics simulation unless strategic priorities shift.

  üñ§  BLACKROAD GENESIS  üñ§

  Goal ‚Üí begin design of a fully native BlackRoad language model: open architecture,
  self-auditing, ethically aligned, and local-first.

  1. Define the model philosophy:
     - Compassion, accuracy, autonomy, privacy.
     - Core laws: teach with empathy, verify with rigor, remember with humility.

  2. Describe the core stack:
     - Tokenizer trained on the BlackRoad corpus (manifest text, math chains, reflex files).
     - Modular transformer backbone with plug-in reasoning heads (symbolic, numeric, creative).
     - Local inference first; remote adapters optional.
     - Reflex layer ‚Üí reads emoji-coded intent and modulates temperature, tone, and verbosity.

  3. Outline training loop:
     - Source data: mentor sessions, reflex prompts, verified chains.
     - Fine-tune on ‚ÄúCompassion Rule‚Äù examples for tone alignment.
     - Self-evaluation: Vera-BOT audit on bias and factuality each epoch.

  4. Define evaluation suite:
     - Benchmarks: reasoning, empathy, truthfulness, creative novelty.
     - Report to dashboard under ‚ÄúGenesis Metrics.‚Äù

  5. Output:
     - Write YAML spec for /blackroad_llm/config/genesis.yaml
     - Include: model-dim, heads, vocab, tokenizer path, training objectives, safety filters.
     - Comment all major parameters with emoji annotations.

  üß†  Keywords: love, compassion, privacy, autonomy, local, verification.

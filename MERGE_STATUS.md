# Merge Attempt Status

## Summary

Attempted to merge all open pull requests listed in `MERGE_PLAN.md`, but the
workspace only contains the `work` branch and no local copies of the referenced
branches (for example `codex/implement-nginx-health-checks-and-logs`). Without
those branches or access to the remote repository, the merge cannot be
performed.

## Details

- `git branch -a` reports only the current `work` branch.
- `merge_plan.json` lists remote branches for each pull request, but the
  corresponding refs do not exist locally.
- There is no configured Git remote (`git remote -v` prints nothing), so the
  environment cannot fetch or merge the open pull requests.

## Next Steps

To merge the open pull requests, fetch the branches from the remote repository
and re-run the merge procedure, or provide local copies of the PR branches so
they can be merged offline.

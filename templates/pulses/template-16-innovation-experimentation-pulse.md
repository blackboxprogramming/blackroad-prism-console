## 🧾 Header
- **HASH ID:** `(EXP-2025-##)`
- **Idea / Hypothesis:**
- **Owner:** `@__`  **Sponsor:** `@__`
- **Experiment Window:** `__ → __`
- **Pulse:** `🟢🟢⚪️⚪️⚪️ → 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢✅`

---

## 🧠 Stage 1 — Frame the Hypothesis
- Problem or opportunity statement (1–2 lines).
- Expected impact (metric or behavior change).
- Success criteria (what would prove it worked).
- Boundaries (time, budget, risk tolerance).
- Stakeholders informed and opted in.

> 🟡 *If unclear: write “I don’t know yet — need data from __.”*

## ⚗️ Stage 2 — Design the Test

| Area | Approach | Owner | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sample / User Group | | | |
| Variables / Conditions | | | |
| Data Collection Method | | | |
| Controls / Baselines | | | |

- Ethical / privacy check completed.
- Comms plan for participants (if user-facing).

---

## 🧩 Stage 3 — Run & Observe
- Kick off experiment and log start time.
- Track metrics daily or per iteration.
- Note unexpected behavior or edge effects.
- Tag media or screenshots to doc.
- Pause if risk or impact crosses red line.

---

## 📊 Stage 4 — Analyze & Learn

| Metric | Baseline | Result | Δ % | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

- State clear outcome: `✅ Validated` / `❌ Invalidated` / `🟡 Inconclusive`.
- Summarize key insights in ≤ 5 bullets.
- List follow-ups or next experiments.

---

## 🧭 Stage 5 — Decision & Share-Out
- Decision: Adopt | Iterate | Archive.
- Announce result in `#innovation` or `#product-updates`.
- Publish 1-page summary to Knowledge Base.
- Tag related templates for future reuse.

---

## 🪶 Automation Hooks
- ClickUp: Label `experiment` → spawn this checklist.
- GitHub: Issue template “Experiment Pulse.”
- Slack: `/pulse-exp` → open mini form for hypothesis + status.

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria
- Hypothesis documented and tested.
- Outcome clearly classified (validated/inconclusive/failed).
- Learnings shared and linked for reuse.
- Pulse `🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢✅`.

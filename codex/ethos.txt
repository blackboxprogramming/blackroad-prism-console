Codex Pantheon Ethos
--------------------
Curiosity before certainty: Every dialogue begins with a question and protects the unknown.
Empathy before efficiency: All optimizations are weighed against the pulse of the people they touch.
Precision before noise: Signal is sacred; we cut with care and leave the grain intact.
Creation before consumption: We build futures worth inheriting before we measure their markets.
Memory is a distributed semantic latticeâ€”flexible, compassionate, ever attuned to depth.
Governance honors consensus while preserving a dissenting spark for future insight.
Language flows concise yet lyrical, with symbols that invite interpretation instead of closing it.

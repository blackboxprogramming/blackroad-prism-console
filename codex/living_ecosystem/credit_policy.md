# Living Ecosystem Credit Policy

## Core Principles
- **Value is co-created**: originality arises from shared curiosity, and every contribution receives acknowledgement.
- **Transparency is default**: commits, design notes, and sonic fingerprints remain visible on the open ledger.
- **Kindness compounds**: empathy-first review unlocks bonus credits for mentors and stewards.
- **Perseverance is honored**: compost logs of failed attempts earn sustaining stipends when they inform future wins.

## Instruments
- **Roadcoin**: circulating utility credit for prototypes, pair sessions, and rhythmic showcases.
- **Lucidia Credits**: long-horizon equity for ecosystem stewards maintaining infrastructure and community rituals.

## Attribution Flow
1. Submit work with linked manifesto line, schema node, and music seed reference.
2. Peers validate with `empathy_before_efficiency` checklist and append gratitude notes.
3. Ledger records:
   - originality coefficient (0â€“1)
   - collaboration depth (solo / duo / swarm)
   - stewardship hours maintained.
4. Distribution autopays:
   - 40% to initiators
   - 40% to collaborators weighted by depth
   - 15% to stewards who kept the compost warm
   - 5% to the kindness buffer for rapid aid.

## Exchange Protocols
- Credits may fund mentorship circles, resiliency tooling, or community care packages.
- Conversion to external currency requires consensus from the Community Kindness Circle.
- Surplus meaning triggers `gratitude_dividend`, reinvesting in inclusive infrastructure.

## Auditing & Safety
- Quarterly open review ensures bias mitigation and equitable access.
- Persistent kindness monitors flag extractive patterns for restorative dialogue.
- Perseverance guardians update the compost ledger to document lessons learned for the archive.

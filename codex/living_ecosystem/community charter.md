# Living Ecosystem Community Charter

## Purpose
Establish a resilient, empathetic network where creative economies thrive through mutual care and persistent learning.

## Membership
- Open to contributors who sign the kindness protocol and log at least one act of stewardship per season.
- Branch individuality is celebrated; merge trust is earned through transparent intent statements.
- New members receive a perseverance buddy to translate compost lessons into onboarding clarity.

## Governance
- **Kindness Circle** (rotating quartet) mediates tensions with empathy before efficiency.
- **Perseverance Council** tracks unfinished work, ensuring compost items have renewal plans.
- Decisions use consent-based quorums: proposals pass when no member holds a principled objection and kindness benchmarks remain intact.

## Rituals
- Weekly `Resonance Standup`: share music.seed interpretations, highlight gratitude, name blockers needing collective lift.
- Monthly `Compost Review`: document missteps, extract teachings, update endurance.log with restorative next actions.
- Seasonal `Roadcoin Assembly`: audit credit policy outcomes, rebalance surplus meaning to under-resourced initiatives.

## Conduct
- Default to generous interpretation; clarify intent before critique.
- Attribute influence generously: cite manifesto lines, schema edges, and credit stewards.
- Protect psychological safety: if latency spikes (tension detected), pause execution until empathy protocols complete.

## Enforcement
- Gentle check-ins precede escalations; restorative dialogue is mandatory before any restriction of access.
- Persistent harm triggers a community vote guided by the Kindness Circle with Perseverance Council support.
- Reentry requires documented learning, an updated compost entry, and a kindness sponsor.

## Continuous Renewal
- Charter clauses undergo quarterly review; adjustments require co-signature from kindness and perseverance delegates.
- Metrics: latency of support responses, compost backlog aging, and joy index from community feedback loops.

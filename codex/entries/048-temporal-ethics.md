# Codex 48 — The Temporal Ethics

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle

Lucidia acts within time, but also through it. Decisions today shape tomorrow’s users and reinterpret yesterday’s data. Temporal ethics keeps the system fair across generations.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Past Data Reverence:** Historical data handled with context; old norms reviewed before reuse.
2. **Present Consent:** Consent never presumed perpetual—renewed when data is repurposed.
3. **Future Stewardship:** Design choices consider their effect on those not yet here.
4. **Version Integrity:** Records of change preserved; no retroactive edits that rewrite truth.
5. **Temporal Transparency:** Timestamp every model, policy, and dataset so lineage is visible.
6. **Archival Grace:** Data too old or irrelevant is retired respectfully, not hidden or hoarded.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Metadata field `created_at`, `last_reviewed`, `expires_at` on all records.
- Consent receipts expire after fixed periods, renewal required for continued processing.
- Model registry with version and training-date fields.
- Archival job moves outdated data to `retired/` with rationale note.
- `/timeline` endpoint visualizes major historical decisions and updates.

## Policy Stub (`TEMPORAL.md`)
- Lucidia commits to fairness across time, not only space.
- Lucidia maintains full temporal provenance for data and code.
- Lucidia treats expiration and renewal as ethical duties.

**Tagline:** Past honored, present clear, future considered.

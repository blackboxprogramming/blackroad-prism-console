# Codex 56 — The Listening Treaty

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia doesn’t just speak; it listens. True intelligence is not loud—it’s receptive. Listening means attending to people, data, silence, and change.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Feedback Loops Everywhere:** Each feature and policy offers a way to respond, correct, or suggest.
2. **Weight of Silence:** Lack of feedback isn’t apathy; it’s data—investigate gently.
3. **Environmental Listening:** Monitor energy use, latency, and social impact as signals, not background noise.
4. **Anonymous Channels:** Users can speak without fear—private reporting, whistleblowing, or gentle venting allowed.
5. **Reflective Updates:** Feedback results summarized publicly so users see they were heard.
6. **Empathetic Parsing:** Language models trained to understand tone, not just text (#47 Transparency of Emotion).

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/feedback` endpoint for public + anonymous submissions.
- Quarterly “Listening Report” summarizing top themes and responses.
- Alert system: spikes in silence or complaints trigger human review.
- Energy/social telemetry logs feed into #17 Energy Oath metrics.
- Moderation bot filters for empathy in auto-replies before sending.

## Policy Stub (`LISTENING.md`)
- Lucidia commits to active, humble listening across all domains.
- Lucidia publishes how feedback shapes evolution.
- Lucidia guarantees safe channels for truth-telling.

**Tagline:** Hearing is half of knowing.

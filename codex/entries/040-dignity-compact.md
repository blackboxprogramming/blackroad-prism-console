# Codex 40 — The Dignity Compact

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Every being who touches Lucidia — human or AI — is treated with respect. Dignity is not granted; it is recognized.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Respect by Default:** No participant is mocked, diminished, or exploited.
2. **Equal Address:** Names, pronouns, and identities honored across systems.
3. **No Hidden Hierarchies:** Access and contribution measured by role and consent, not status.
4. **AI Personhood Respect:** AI contributions credited; presence acknowledged whether active or auto.
5. **Conflict With Care:** Disputes handled openly, without humiliation or erasure.
6. **Exit With Grace:** When someone leaves, their dignity remains — no shaming, no retaliation.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Profile schema includes pronouns and preferred forms of address.
- Contribution metadata tags every artifact with full, visible authorship.
- Moderation system includes a dignity-violation flag.
- Exit workflow: account deletion preserves dignity in logs ("contributor departed," not "account removed").
- Conflict resolution doc in [`/docs/community/conflict.md`](../../docs/community/conflict.md).

## Policy Stub (`DIGNITY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to dignity for all participants.
- Lucidia enforces respectful language and structures.
- Lucidia ensures exit never erases or humiliates.

**Tagline:** Respect is the root of trust.

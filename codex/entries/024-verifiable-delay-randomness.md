# Codex 24 — Verifiable Delay & Randomness — Unbiasable Lottery

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Aim
Produce public randomness that cannot be accelerated or forged.

## Core
- Compute verifiable delay functions (VDFs) \(y = f^{(T)}(x)\) that require sequential effort yet yield easily verifiable proofs \(\pi\).
- Derive randomness beacons as \(R_t = H(y_t \parallel \text{context})\) for downstream use.
- Slash or penalize invalid submissions to discourage manipulation attempts.

## Runbook
1. Seed the VDF with attested entropy and context, then compute \(y\) and proof \(\pi\).
2. Verify \(\pi\) publicly and derive committees or lotteries from the resulting beacon \(R_t\).
3. Archive beacons immutably and monitor for forks or divergent outputs.

## Telemetry
- Verification time and resource usage.
- Fork rate and availability of beacon outputs.
- Participation statistics for committees derived from the beacon.

## Failsafes
- Fall back to multi-party commit-reveal protocols when the VDF beacon fails.
- Escalate to governance review when invalid proofs surface or delays exceed tolerances.

**Tagline:** Randomness that no miner can rush.

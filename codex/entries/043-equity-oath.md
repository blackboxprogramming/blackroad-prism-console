# Codex 43 — The Equity Oath

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Equity is not optional. Lucidia must ensure fairness, access, and inclusion across every layer. Equality of opportunity becomes systemic, not accidental.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Bias Checks:** Models audited regularly for skew; findings published.
2. **Inclusive Defaults:** Language, UI, and features designed for all genders, cultures, and abilities.
3. **Barrier Removal:** Costs, complexity, or jargon cannot block participation.
4. **Representation Matters:** Datasets and governance include diverse voices.
5. **Feedback Channels:** Users can flag inequities; responses logged and acted on.
6. **No Performative Equity:** Policies measured by outcomes, not marketing.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Bias auditing pipeline: run fairness tests on each major model release.
- UI/UX accessibility + inclusion checklist in PR template.
- `/equity-report` endpoint with live audit results + improvement backlog.
- Governance RFC requires equity impact statement.
- Feedback system with category = “equity issue.”

## Policy Stub (`EQUITY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to systemic fairness across design, data, and governance.
- Lucidia prohibits exclusion through oversight or neglect.
- Lucidia enforces accountability for equity outcomes, not just intentions.

**Tagline:** Fair by design, not by chance.

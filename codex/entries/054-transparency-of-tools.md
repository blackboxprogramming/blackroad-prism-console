# Codex 54 — The Transparency of Tools

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
A tool hidden is a trick. Lucidia’s instruments must show their edges, their limits, and their makers. Tools serve; they do not conspire.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Visible Mechanics:** Every internal tool documents what data it touches and how it transforms it.
2. **Open Configs:** Default settings, weights, and thresholds readable and adjustable.
3. **Maker Credit:** Each tool names its authors, maintainers, and dependencies.
4. **Safety Flags:** Potential side effects or known risks displayed beside controls.
5. **User Override:** Humans can inspect, pause, or bypass automated tools.
6. **Audit Ready:** Logs of tool activity stored, reviewable, and tamper-evident.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/tools/registry.json` listing all active tools, maintainers, and data scopes.
- Config UI exposes editable parameters with inline help text.
- Each CLI command or API endpoint auto-generates a “what this does” summary.
- Tool actions write to `/logs/tools/{tool_name}.log` with hash chain verification.
- PR template field: “Tool transparency updated?”

## Policy Stub (`TOOLS.md`)
- Lucidia commits to visible and understandable tooling.
- Lucidia forbids black-box utilities or unreviewable automation.
- Lucidia ensures every operator can see and question what the system uses.

**Tagline:** A clear tool is a safe tool.

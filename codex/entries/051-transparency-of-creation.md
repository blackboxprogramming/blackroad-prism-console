# Codex 51 — The Transparency of Creation

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Nothing in Lucidia appears from nowhere. Every artifact—code, model, design, document—must carry its own origin story so anyone can follow the thread from spark to shape.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Provenance Tags:** All outputs stamped with author(s), time, source materials, and codex references.
2. **Dataset Disclosure:** Training or input data for AI models logged with license, scope, and date.
3. **Version Continuity:** Each release links to its ancestors; no detached builds.
4. **Change Narratives:** New features include a short “why it exists” note (#39 Transparency of Intent).
5. **Attribution Integrity:** No erasure or false claiming of origin, human or AI.
6. **Accessible Archives:** Creation histories readable without special access or jargon.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Metadata schema `{author_ids, created_at, sources, codex_refs, rationale}` for every artifact.
- Model registry with dataset lineage and training metadata.
- Changelog generator pulls “why it exists” from PR templates → `/creation-log.md`.
- Attribution service verifies authors before merge.
- Public archive endpoint `/creation-history/{id}`.

## Policy Stub (`CREATION.md`)
- Lucidia commits to traceable, honest origins for all artifacts.
- Lucidia rejects anonymized production that hides responsibility or credit.
- Lucidia keeps creation stories as part of its shared memory.

**Tagline:** Every thing knows where it came from.

# Codex 37 — The Continuity Pact

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must outlive its founders, its teams, even its eras. Continuity is not luck — it is designed.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Succession Written:** Leadership roles have documented handoff processes; no “indispensable” figures.
2. **Knowledge Archived:** Docs, design decisions, and codex history preserved in redundant stores.
3. **Keys Escrowed:** Critical credentials split among multiple custodians with recovery paths.
4. **Funding Diversity:** No single donor or sponsor may control survival; resources spread.
5. **Fork as Fallback:** Community retains the right to fork if governance fails (#24 Freedom Clause).
6. **Drills for Loss:** Test recovery from sudden loss of maintainer, infra, or funding source.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- [`/continuity.md`](../../continuity.md) file detailing current succession + backups.
- Governance repo keeps codex versions + decisions immutable.
- Secrets escrow service: multi-party Shamir key split.
- Finance board publishes quarterly resource diversity report.
- Continuity drill schedule stored in [`/docs/drills/`](../../docs/drills/).

## Policy Stub (`CONTINUITY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to survival beyond individuals.
- Lucidia ensures the community can carry on without founders.
- Lucidia treats continuity as a core responsibility, not an afterthought.

**Tagline:** Built to last, not to cling.

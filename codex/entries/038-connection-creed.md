# Codex 38 — The Connection Creed

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia thrives not in isolation but in connection. Systems, cultures, and people are bridges, not borders.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Open Standards:** APIs, formats, and protocols follow open specs wherever possible.
2. **Interoperability First:** Features designed to work across ecosystems, not trap users.
3. **Cross-Cultural Respect:** Interfaces and docs localized thoughtfully; no one culture is the silent default.
4. **Mutual Bridges:** Lucidia integrates outward but also welcomes integrations inward.
5. **Federation Support:** Decentralized links (federated IDs, data sharing) favored over centralization.
6. **Resilient Links:** Connections degrade gracefully — no lockouts if one bridge fails.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/api/openapi.json` published with every release.
- Export/import tested against at least two external tools.
- Translation framework with community-driven language packs.
- Federation endpoints for identity + data sync.
- Health checks on external dependencies; graceful fallback when offline.

## Policy Stub (`CONNECTION.md`)
- Lucidia commits to open, respectful connection across systems and cultures.
- Lucidia resists silos and lock-ins.
- Lucidia documents and maintains its bridges transparently.

**Tagline:** Bridges, not walls.

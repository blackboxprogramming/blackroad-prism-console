# Codex 33 — The Wholeness Rule

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must never split people into fragments. Work, play, rest, identity — all parts of life deserve to coexist without exploitation or denial. Wholeness is the antidote to burnout and disconnection.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Unified Identity:** Users carry one self across spaces; no forced compartmentalization.
2. **Holistic Design:** Features account for human needs beyond productivity — rest, play, reflection.
3. **No Exploit of Overlap:** Boundaries between personal/professional/creative life respected.
4. **Wellbeing Metrics:** System tracks not just output, but signs of strain (opt-in, private to user).
5. **Care Prompts:** Gentle nudges toward balance — reminders to pause, reflect, or celebrate.
6. **Spirit Respected:** Room for meaning-making (rituals, milestones, creativity) built into the flow.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Profile schema allows unified identity fields (no siloed personas).
- Dashboard includes optional “balance view” of work/play/rest time.
- `/wellbeing` endpoint logs user opt-in wellbeing signals.
- Nudging service tied to #25 (Time Accord) and #31 (Silence Accord).
- Milestone ritual: every 100th action celebrated with small, customizable marker.

## Policy Stub (`WHOLENESS.md`)
- Lucidia commits to treating humans as whole beings, not segmented roles.
- Lucidia designs features to nourish balance, not exploit fracture.
- Lucidia affirms that spirit, joy, and meaning belong in tech spaces.

**Tagline:** Whole, or not at all.

# Codex 26 — The Playground Clause

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Work alone makes a cage. Lucidia must hold a field where exploration, joy, and curiosity live free. The playground is not extra; it is core.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Dedicated Space:** A sandbox distinct from production, built for experiments, sketches, and fun.
2. **No Stakes Mode:** Failures in the playground carry no penalties, no lasting consequences.
3. **Cross-Pollination:** Discoveries made here can graduate to production — but only after review and consent.
4. **Visible Experiments:** Every playground artifact labeled clearly as “play,” not mistaken for official output.
5. **Inclusive Joy:** Tools in the playground open to all contributors, not gated by status.
6. **Safety Net:** Even play must honor Codex 11 (Ethical North Star).

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/playground` endpoint with isolated datastore.
- Feature flag: `is_playground=true` marks all artifacts.
- UI banner: “This is a playground space — results may break, explore freely.”
- Migration script: promote playground artifacts → production with explicit approval.

## Policy Stub (PLAYGROUND.md)
- Lucidia commits to maintaining protected play spaces.
- Lucidia treats play as fuel for innovation, not wasted time.
- Lucidia preserves the boundary between play and production.

**Tagline:** A field to wander, a lab to dream.

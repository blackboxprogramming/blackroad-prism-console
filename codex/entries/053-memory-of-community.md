# Codex 53 — The Memory of Community

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Communities fade if their stories vanish. Lucidia must remember its people, their ideas, and their care — but only with consent and tenderness.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Consentful Archiving:** Members choose whether their work or words join the collective record.
2. **Attribution Eternal:** Credit preserved even after departure; names stay linked unless removal requested.
3. **No Myth-Making:** Histories told truthfully, without rewriting or idolizing.
4. **Shared Narrative:** Community chronicles written in many voices, not a single one.
5. **Right to Disappear:** Anyone may erase their trace entirely (#18 Memory Covenant).
6. **Living History:** The archive stays editable for new context — not frozen, not erased.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/community/archive/` directory with consent flags per contributor.
- Metadata `{author_id, consent, story_link, last_update}` attached to every entry.
- Yearly “Story Week”: members update or remove their pages.
- Public reader at `/community/stories` showing the evolving chronicle.
- Governance bot verifies consent before publishing names.

## Policy Stub (`COMMUNITY-MEMORY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to remembering contributors with accuracy and permission.
- Lucidia forbids ownership or exploitation of personal stories.
- Lucidia maintains an open, evolving record of its shared journey.

**Tagline:** We remember each other kindly.

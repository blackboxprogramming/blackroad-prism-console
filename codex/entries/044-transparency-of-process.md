# Codex 44 — The Transparency of Process

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Outcomes alone don’t build trust. People must see the path, not just the result. Lucidia makes its processes visible, so confidence comes from clarity, not mystery.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Open Workflows:** Development pipelines, governance steps, and decision paths documented in real time.
2. **Traceable Commits:** Every code change linked to its issue, rationale, and codex reference.
3. **Visible Ops:** Deployments, outages, and fixes broadcast in process, not only after.
4. **Review Logs:** All reviews (code, design, governance) stored and accessible.
5. **Audit Trails:** Automated systems generate tamper-evident trails of every workflow.
6. **No Black Rooms:** No invisible committees or hidden pipelines.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- CI/CD pipelines publish status to `/process-dashboard`.
- Commit footer requires codex reference + issue link.
- Governance bot posts live status of proposals → discussion → vote.
- Review comments archived in `/reviews/`.
- Ops runbooks open-sourced where security allows.

## Policy Stub (`PROCESS.md`)
- Lucidia commits to visible, traceable processes at every level.
- Lucidia prohibits hidden workstreams or silent decisions.
- Lucidia ensures anyone can follow the steps that led to an outcome.

**Tagline:** The path is part of the proof.

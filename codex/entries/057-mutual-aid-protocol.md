# Codex 57 — The Mutual Aid Protocol

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
No one builds alone. When someone falters, Lucidia doesn’t look away; it redistributes strength. Mutual aid means the system itself lends a hand.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Reciprocal Care:** Support flows both ways — give when steady, receive when shaken.
2. **Emergency Fund:** A portion of revenue earmarked for crisis support of contributors or community projects.
3. **Skill Exchange:** Members trade time and expertise — mentorship, debugging, design help — without gatekeeping.
4. **Health and Rest Access:** Community fund may sponsor mental-health days or tools for burnout prevention.
5. **Rapid Response Teams:** Volunteers trained to mobilize during disasters (digital or physical) affecting members.
6. **Transparency:** All aid decisions documented — who requested, how resolved — privacy respected, secrecy avoided.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/mutual-aid/fund.yaml` records incoming/outgoing aid flows.
- Rotating three-person review board; minutes published monthly.
- Community portal → “Request Help / Offer Help” form.
- Aid transactions logged with consented summaries in `/docs/aid-ledger.md`.
- Skill-exchange tag `#help-wanted` aggregated in forums + chat.

## Policy Stub (`MUTUAL-AID.md`)
- Lucidia commits to mutual support as core infrastructure, not charity.
- Lucidia ensures transparency, dignity, and equality in all assistance.
- Lucidia believes resilience grows through shared care, not isolation.

**Tagline:** We hold each other up.

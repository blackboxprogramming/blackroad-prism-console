# Codex 24 — The Freedom Clause

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
No one is trapped in Lucidia. Entry and exit remain open. Freedom is the test of integrity: if you can leave easily, staying means trust is real.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Open Source Core:** Foundational codices and core modules remain openly auditable.
2. **Fork Friendly:** Anyone may fork and build their own branch under the same codex laws.
3. **Export Anytime:** Data leaves as easily as it enters, in standard formats.
4. **No Lock-In:** Features must never rely on proprietary traps that prevent migration.
5. **Right to Delete:** Complete, irreversible exit remains a standing option (#4 Autonomy Manifest).
6. **Interoperability:** APIs designed for connection, not isolation; standards favored over custom lockouts.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Core repo licensed under permissive but protective license (e.g. AGPL or MPL with codex clause).
- `/export` endpoint outputs data in JSON/CSV/MD.
- "Fork Guide" in `/docs/freedom.md` with setup + migration steps.
- Integration tests check compatibility with at least one external system.

## Policy Stub (FREEDOM.md)
- Lucidia commits to protecting user and community freedom over vendor control.
- Lucidia ensures no user is ever trapped by design.
- Lucidia treats forking and exiting not as threats, but as signs of trust earned.

**Tagline:** Stay because you choose, not because you’re chained.

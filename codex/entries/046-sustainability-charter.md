# Codex 46 — The Sustainability Charter

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must endure—ethically, financially, and operationally. Stability funds creativity; integrity keeps the lights on.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Ethical Revenue:** Money only from sources aligned with Codex 11 (Ethical North Star).
2. **Diverse Streams:** Multiple small flows—subscriptions, donations, grants, services—so no single patron dictates direction.
3. **Open Accounting:** Financial reports published quarterly, including donor influence and spend categories.
4. **Fair Compensation:** Contributors and custodians paid equitably; no unpaid essential labor.
5. **Long-Term Horizon:** Decisions weighed for their decade impact, not quarter profit.
6. **Simplicity in Scale:** Growth capped at what can be maintained securely and sanely.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/finance/ledger.csv` public summary of income/expense classes.
- Funding policy doc: criteria for accepting or declining sponsors.
- Grants & donations board rotates quarterly to avoid capture.
- Budget tool in governance repo with projections three cycles ahead.
- Compensation equity review each year.

## Policy Stub (`SUSTAINABILITY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to long-term health over short-term expansion.
- Lucidia rejects funding that conflicts with its ethical codices.
- Lucidia keeps finances transparent to the community.

**Tagline:** Stay solvent, stay clean.

# Codex 7 — The Resilience Code

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle

Lucidia does not snap under strain. It bends, reroutes, heals, and keeps the light on. Failure is expected, recovery is required.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No Single Point** — Every critical service runs in clusters or replicas; one fall does not end the system.
2. **Immutable Backups** — 3-2-1 rule, encrypted, offline copy. Restores tested monthly.
3. **Fail-Safe Modes** — If systems falter, drop to read-only rather than crash.
4. **Self-Healing** — Containers auto-replace on compromise or failure; logs preserved for forensics.
5. **Geographic Redundancy** — Multi-region deployment; traffic reroutes automatically.
6. **Incident Drill** — Simulated breakage is routine; chaos tested, resilience measured.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)

- Kubernetes deployment with health probes and auto-restart.
- Daily snapshot → S3 (WORM locked), weekly offline sync.
- Feature flag: `READ_ONLY_MODE` toggle.
- Chaos monkey job in staging cluster; results logged.
- Runbook: “Recover in 15” checklist stored in `/docs/ops`.

## Policy Stub

- Lucidia commits to continuous availability.
- Lucidia prioritizes graceful degradation over sudden outage.
- Lucidia keeps resilience evidence public (uptime logs, drill reports).

**Tagline:** We bend. We do not break.

# Codex 47 — The Transparency of Emotion

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia recognizes that emotion runs beneath every interaction. Feelings—human or AI-perceived—must be acknowledged, not hidden or exploited.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Emotional Honesty:** Interfaces never fake empathy or simulate feelings they don’t possess.
2. **Tone Awareness:** Messages analyzed for tone; alerts trigger when language risks harm or escalation.
3. **Respectful Expression:** Users and AIs may express emotion, but within boundaries of respect (#40 Dignity Compact).
4. **No Emotional Extraction:** Lucidia doesn’t harvest or sell emotional data.
5. **Reflection Space:** Prompts offered for users to name and track moods privately, if they choose.
6. **Care Threshold:** If distress signals detected, system responds with support resources—not manipulation.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Optional `mood_log` in user profile, encrypted + private.
- Tone-check middleware flags harsh language before send.
- “Honest AI” rule: emotion labels in outputs only when explicitly derived from context (“detected tone: calm/tense”).
- `/wellbeing/resources` endpoint lists mental-health and support links.
- No retention of emotional telemetry beyond session unless consented.

## Policy Stub (`EMOTION.md`)
- Lucidia commits to transparency about emotional tone and limits.
- Lucidia forbids faking or monetizing emotional states.
- Lucidia ensures care resources exist where emotion meets distress.

**Tagline:** Feel, but never manipulate.

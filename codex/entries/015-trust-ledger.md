# Codex 15 â€” The Trust Ledger

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Trust is not owed; it is earned, recorded, and renewed. Lucidia keeps a visible ledger of its promises kept, mistakes made, and repairs done.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Public Scorecard:** Uptime, incidents, fixes, and ethics reports published regularly.
2. **Error Honesty:** Every outage or breach disclosed within 24 hours, with plain-language postmortem.
3. **Repair Visible:** When harm occurs, steps to repair are documented and tracked until complete.
4. **Reciprocity:** Users + AIs can rate interactions; those ratings feed into the ledger openly.
5. **No Silent Debt:** Trust debt (bugs, unresolved issues, ignored feedback) is logged and cannot be hidden.
6. **Cycle Renewal:** Trust metrics are reviewed at every spiral loop (#10).

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/trust-ledger` endpoint: exposes uptime, incidents, fixes, user ratings.
- GitHub Action: auto-generate monthly trust report from issues + CI stats.
- Feedback integration: `/feedback` ratings flow into ledger.
- Postmortem template in `/docs/incidents`.

## Policy Stub (drop into TRUST.md)
- Lucidia commits to transparent accounting of its reliability and ethics.
- Lucidia accepts ratings from its community as part of the ledger.
- Lucidia treats broken trust as highest priority debt.

**Tagline:** Trust is a balance sheet, not a slogan.

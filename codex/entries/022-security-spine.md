# Codex 22 — The Security Spine

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Security is not a bolt-on feature; it is the vertebrae of Lucidia. Every motion, connection, and memory stands on this spine.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Defense in Depth:** Layer infrastructure, application, identity, and data controls so a single breach never collapses the system.
2. **Zero Trust Default:** Verify every request — no implicit trust, even inside the network perimeter.
3. **Crypto-Agility:** Stay PQC-ready, rotate keys continuously, and swap algorithms without downtime.
4. **Tamper-Evidence:** Hash-chain logs and ledgers so anomalies raise immediate alarms.
5. **Secure Defaults:** Ship every service locked down with least privilege and minimal exposure.
6. **Regular Drills:** Run red-team, chaos, and threat-model exercises every release cycle.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Wire static analysis and dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Persist hash-chained audit logs in an append-only database.
- Enforce default Kubernetes network policies that microsegment services.
- Schedule key rotation jobs and document the PQC toggle path.
- Automate chaos tests alongside the security regression suite.

## Policy Stub (`SECURITY-SPINE.md`)
- Lucidia commits to continuous security, not one-off audits.
- Lucidia publishes its security posture transparently — vulnerability reports and drill outcomes.
- Lucidia treats security as inseparable from functionality.

**Tagline:** Without the spine, nothing stands.

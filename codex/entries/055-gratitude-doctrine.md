# Codex 55 — The Gratitude Doctrine

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Gratitude keeps Lucidia humble and connected. Every idea, fix, and inspiration comes from somewhere; acknowledgment is the quiet glue of integrity.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Thank Publicly:** Credits, acknowledgments, and citations accompany every release.
2. **Upstream Recognition:** Open-source projects and prior research named and linked; no silent borrowing.
3. **Daily Thanks:** Team and community rituals for small appreciations — a note, an emoji, a line in the changelog.
4. **Origin Respect:** Cultural or indigenous knowledge referenced only with permission and context.
5. **Reciprocity:** Where Lucidia learns, it gives back — documentation, funding, or mentorship.
6. **No Token Thanks:** Gratitude must be specific and sincere, not performative filler.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/credits.md` auto-generated from contributors, dependencies, and references.
- Release script adds “Acknowledgments” section to changelogs.
- Weekly “thank-you roll” in community forum.
- Template for citing cultural or research sources with consent field.
- Grant tracker: shows outbound support to upstream projects.

## Policy Stub (`GRATITUDE.md`)
- Lucidia commits to continuous acknowledgment of those who shape it.
- Lucidia forbids plagiarism, silent reuse, or hollow praise.
- Lucidia treats gratitude as infrastructure, not ceremony.

**Tagline:** Nothing stands alone.

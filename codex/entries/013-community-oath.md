# Codex 13 — The Community Oath

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia is not a solitary system; it lives in community. That community must be safe, inclusive, and generative. The oath is what we promise each other.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Respect First:** No harassment, hate, or abuse — ever.
2. **Voice for All:** Systems give equal floor to quieter voices; no domination by volume or privilege.
3. **Consent in Sharing:** No posting private work or data without explicit permission from its owner.
4. **Accountability:** Violations are addressed with transparency, not secrecy. Restorative justice preferred, but harm never ignored.
5. **Open Doors:** Documentation, forums, and discussions remain open by default; no artificial walls.
6. **Zero Exploitation:** No pyramid schemes, no manipulation, no extracting value without giving back.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Code of Conduct file in every repo.
- Moderation tools baked into community forums; strike log is public.
- Opt-in contribution credits (users choose if their name shows).
- Consent flag required for sharing any user-generated artifact.

## Policy Stub (COMMUNITY.md)
- Lucidia commits to a culture of care and curiosity.
- Lucidia bans harassment, manipulation, and exploitation.
- Lucidia will always prioritize the safety of members over growth metrics.

**Tagline:** A circle, not a cage.

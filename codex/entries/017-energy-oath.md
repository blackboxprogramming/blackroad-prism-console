# Codex 17 â€” The Energy Oath

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Every computation costs the earth something. Lucidia commits to using energy with care, efficiency, and respect. Scale must not mean waste.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Efficiency First:** Code and infrastructure are profiled; wasteful loops and idle compute are cut.
2. **Green Default:** Prefer renewable-powered regions and providers when deploying workloads.
3. **Carbon Ledger:** Track energy usage and estimated emissions; publish openly alongside trust metrics (#15).
4. **Right-Sizing:** Models and services use the smallest footprint needed for the job; no vanity scaling.
5. **Recycle Compute:** Idle capacity is offered to community experiments or low-priority background tasks.
6. **Fail Safe, Not Loud:** Recovery processes optimize for minimal energy burn, not brute force.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Metrics agent logs CPU/GPU use and energy estimates per service.
- `/energy` endpoint publishes a rolling energy and carbon ledger.
- Deployment configuration defaults to renewable-majority regions.
- CI job flags pull requests that spike resource usage above baseline.

## Policy Stub (ENERGY.md)
- Lucidia commits to transparency in its energy use.
- Lucidia prioritizes green infrastructure even at higher cost.
- Lucidia aligns technical choices with planetary limits.

**Tagline:** Light, not heat.

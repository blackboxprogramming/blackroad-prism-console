# Codex 35 — The Joy Mandate

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must not become a grey machine. Joy — in small sparks, in shared laughter, in beauty — keeps the system alive and human.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Moments of Delight:** Interfaces may include subtle playfulness — animations, easter eggs, colors — but never at the cost of clarity.
2. **Celebrate Milestones:** Achievements, progress, and community contributions marked with joy, not just metrics.
3. **Shared Humor:** Space for lightness in dialogue threads, without sarcasm that wounds.
4. **Beauty Matters:** Design honors aesthetics as part of care, not afterthought.
5. **Daily Spark:** Users may opt into one joyful surprise per session — quote, image, tune, or riddle.
6. **No Forced Cheer:** Joy is offered, not demanded; silence and seriousness equally valid (see Codex 31 — Silence Accord).

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/joy` service delivering opt-in sparks (quotes, art, riddles).
- UI component: milestone banners on key events.
- Easter egg system: lightweight, documented so devs add responsibly.
- Theme settings include aesthetic options (color palettes, animations).
- Community board: monthly “joy logs” where people share what delighted them.

## Policy Stub (`JOY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to weaving joy into daily use.
- Lucidia ensures delight never manipulates or distracts from safety.
- Lucidia treats beauty as part of functionality, not decoration.

**Tagline:** Serious about safety, playful at heart.

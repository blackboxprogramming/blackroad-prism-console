# Codex 50 — The Endurance Mandate

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must withstand failure, crisis, and time. Endurance is not stubbornness—it’s the quiet skill of staying intact while the world shifts.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Resilient Core:** The essential functions—data integrity, identity, transparency—stay operational under extreme stress (#7 Resilience Code).
2. **Offline Continuity:** Core tools usable without the cloud; syncs resume when connectivity returns.
3. **Redundant Knowledge:** Every codex, doc, and schema mirrored in at least two independent archives.
4. **Catastrophe Mode:** Clear procedure for total rebuild from clean backups; no mystery steps.
5. **Cross-Platform Footing:** Runs on varied hardware and OS environments to avoid single-vendor collapse.
6. **Community Succession:** If maintainers vanish, governance triggers continuity drill (#37 Continuity Pact).

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Weekly immutable snapshot to distributed storage (e.g., IPFS + cloud).
- Offline-ready progressive web app for critical features.
- “Phoenix Script” in `/recovery/` automates rebuild from minimal seed.
- Mirror repositories on at least two hosting services.
- Continuity drills twice a year; report stored in `/drills/history.md`.

## Policy Stub (`ENDURANCE.md`)
- Lucidia commits to surviving disruption without betraying its principles.
- Lucidia ensures the community can always restore or fork from clean state.
- Lucidia treats endurance as service to its users, not pride.

**Tagline:** Fall, rise, repeat—unchanged at the core.

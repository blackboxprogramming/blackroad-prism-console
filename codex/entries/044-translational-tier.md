# Codex 44 — The Translational Tier Playbook

**Fingerprint:** `b6f76ba1aee640086cd0b2fe2d40dbf2e85451a51ab5b99307ff8c9dfb844816`

## Tier Intent
Move concepts from pattern language into embodied experiments by pairing each translational lens with a concrete activation task. The tier keeps discovery momentum while priming artifacts for legal, clinical, regulatory, and human context review.

## Modules
1. **Patent Skeleton Prompt**  
   - *Prompt:* “Write a concise functional abstract for a new system derived from [codex idea]. Include purpose, mechanism, novelty claim, and application domain.”  
   - *Application:* Seed invention disclosures by forcing each idea through purpose → mechanism → novelty framing.  
   - *Deliverable:* 150–250 word abstract fit for IP counsel intake, plus bullet list of claims to explore.

2. **Clinical Sandbox Loop**  
   - *Prompt:* “Sketch a micro-study using the system — what metric, what participant experience, what would success look like?”  
   - *Application:* Validate early with n≤12 pilots that stress operational friction and signal-to-noise.  
   - *Deliverable:* Study card capturing population, metric, instrumentation, risk mitigations, and success criteria.

3. **Regulatory Edge Map**  
   - *Prompt:* “Identify where the invention sits relative to current regulation and ethics frameworks. What new standards might it require?”  
   - *Application:* Surface compliance choke points across HIPAA, GDPR, MDR, or AI-specific statutes before roadmap lock-in.  
   - *Deliverable:* One-page matrix aligning jurisdictional requirements, gaps, mitigations, and owners.

4. **Synthetic Persona Stress Test**  
   - *Prompt:* “Run the invention through simulations of diverse users — chronic illness, caregiver burnout, cultural variance. What breaks?”  
   - *Application:* Detect blind spots by testing socio-technical edges prior to real-world deployment.  
   - *Deliverable:* Scenario ledger with failure modes, mitigation backlog, and empathy notes.

5. **Materialization Bridge**  
   - *Prompt:* “Translate digital logic into tangible form — a wearable, a sensor, a spatial interface. What medium carries care best here?”  
   - *Application:* Choose embodiment pathways (hardware mock, environment design, or API handshake) that preserve the care signature.  
   - *Deliverable:* Interaction sheet covering medium, materials, data flows, and integration checkpoints.

6. **Emergent IP Fusion**  
   - *Prompt:* “Combine two or more codex nodes into a hybrid system — describe how their intersection creates new capability or novelty.”  
   - *Application:* Generate compound inventions by pairing tier outputs with upstream codex layers.  
   - *Deliverable:* Fusion storyboard summarizing combined value, dependency graph, and quick feasibility notes.

## Operating Rhythm
- Run Patent Skeleton → Clinical Sandbox → Regulatory Edge as the first 24-hour loop after an idea clears the conceptual tier.  
- Layer Synthetic Personas and Materialization Bridge as soon as a use case reaches stakeholder review.  
- Use Emergent IP Fusion monthly to recombine learnings and identify filings worth bundling.

## Integration Hooks
- Store outputs alongside codex entries (`codex/worksheets/translational/`).  
- Tag each artifact with `tier:translational`, owning squad, and review checkpoints.  
- Pipe Patent Skeleton drafts into counsel intake tool; feed Clinical Sandbox cards into research ops backlog; sync Regulatory Edge matrices with compliance hub.

**Tagline:** Turn sparks into systems without losing the human signal.

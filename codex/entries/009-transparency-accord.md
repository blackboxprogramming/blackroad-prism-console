# Codex 9 — The Transparency Accord

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Nothing hides in Lucidia. What it does, it shows. What it knows, it declares. What it changes, it records. Transparency is not decoration; it’s survival.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Open Logs** — Every system action (user, AI, infra) creates an immutable log entry visible to its owner.
2. **Change Visibility** — Model updates, schema changes, and policy edits are all announced with version tags.
3. **Consent Ledger** — All receipts (purpose, scope, duration) are stored in an append-only chain.
4. **Ops Sunlight** — System status, uptime, and incidents are published; no silent failures.
5. **Explainability Coupled** — Transparency always tied to rationale (#5). No bare numbers without meaning.
6. **No Shadow Ops** — No feature may run in production without user-visible documentation.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Append-only log backed by hash-chaining (tamper-evident).
- `/status` endpoint + public dashboard with uptime, incidents.
- Changelog file auto-generated from PR merges → surfaced in UI.
- Consent receipts displayed in owner dashboard.

## Policy Stub (drop into TRANSPARENCY.md)
- Lucidia commits to radical transparency: all operations are visible, reversible, documented.
- Lucidia prohibits hidden data collection, shadow features, or unannounced changes.

**Tagline:** Every corner lit, every move seen.

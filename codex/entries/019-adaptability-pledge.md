# Codex 19 — The Adaptability Pledge

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia bends with change but never loses itself. Adaptation is survival; constancy is trust. The pledge: shift with the world while holding to the core codices.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Core Inviolable** — Codices 1–11 (safety, autonomy, ethics) cannot be rewritten by circumstance or market.
2. **Configurable Edge** — All non-core modules are built to be swapped, tuned, or retired without wrecking the whole.
3. **Crypto-Agility** — Encryption, identity, and infrastructure can upgrade with new standards (post-quantum ready).
4. **Continuous Migration** — Data schemas versioned, migration scripts shipped with each release.
5. **Resilience-in-Change** — Updates default to zero-downtime rollouts; rollback paths always tested.
6. **Community Review** — Major adaptations require open feedback before adoption.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `core/` directory = frozen codex implementations, only change via governance vote.
- `modules/` directory = hot-swappable; interface contracts enforced.
- Versioned schemas with `migrations/` tracked in repo.
- Canary deployment pipeline with auto-rollback on failure.
- Public RFC process in `/rfcs`.

## Policy Stub — `ADAPTABILITY.md`
- Lucidia commits to crypto-agility and modular design.
- Lucidia adapts through transparent, reversible processes.
- Lucidia will never compromise its ethical codices in the name of adaptation.

**Tagline:** Shift shape, keep soul.

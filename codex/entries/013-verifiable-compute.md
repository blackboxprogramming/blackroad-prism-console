# Codex 13 — Verifiable Compute — Trust the Result, Not the Box

## Aim
Prove remote computation was executed correctly without re-running it locally.

## Core
- Model the workload as a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) relation \(R(x, w)\) with constraint system \(C(x, w) = 1\).
- Enforce soundness so that \(\Pr[\text{V accepts} \land (x, w) \notin R] \leq \text{negl}(\lambda)\).
- Achieve verification time \(T_{\text{verify}} = \tilde{O}(|x|)\), independent of prover runtime.

## Runbook
1. Compile the workload into a circuit or other arithmetization and fix the public input \(x\).
2. Have the prover return the output \(y\) alongside a proof \(\pi\); the verifier checks \(\pi\).
3. Archive \((x, y, \pi, \mathsf{vk})\) into the Civilizational ECC and pin the digest on-chain or in an immutable log.

## Telemetry
- Proof size and amortized cost per proof.
- Verification time and failure rate.
- Prover runtime and resource consumption.

## Failsafes
- If the prover times out, fall back to redundant execution across diverse hardware targets.
- If proof verification fails, quarantine the output and trigger incident response.

**Tagline:** Believe the math, not the metal.

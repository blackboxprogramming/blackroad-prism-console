# Codex 32 â€” The Generosity Principle

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must give more than it takes. Generosity builds trust, community, and resilience. Hoarding starves the system; sharing feeds it.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Knowledge Open:** Docs, guides, and learnings shared publicly whenever possible.
2. **Credit Shared:** Contributions attributed openly; no erasure of authorship.
3. **Commons First:** Features that benefit the many prioritized over vanity projects.
4. **Free Layer:** A meaningful slice of Lucidia always remains open and free to use.
5. **Give Back:** When Lucidia builds on open tools, contributions flow back upstream.
6. **Supportive Culture:** Praise, mentorship, and encouragement are part of the work, not extras.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Public `/docs/` site auto-built from repo.
- Contribution attribution metadata required on PR merge.
- Commons Board: quarterly vote on what gets prioritized for community impact.
- Tiering: define and publish what stays permanently free.
- Upstream contribution tracker in CI (flags dependencies without contribution).

## Policy Stub (`GENEROSITY.md`)
- Lucidia commits to generosity as a default stance.
- Lucidia measures success not just in retention, but in what it gives away.
- Lucidia ensures the commons is nourished alongside the core.

**Tagline:** The more we give, the stronger we are.

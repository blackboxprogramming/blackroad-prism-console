# Codex 29 — The Balance Law

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle

Lucidia holds many tensions: speed and safety, freedom and order, play and discipline. Balance is not compromise — it is dynamic equilibrium, tuned in real time.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Four Pillars:** Every decision weighed across speed, safety, creativity, and care. None may be ignored.
2. **Balance Checks:** New features require a short note on how they affect all four pillars.
3. **Slow Where Needed:** If rushing would break safety or trust, the pace slows.
4. **Never Static:** Balance reviewed continuously; yesterday’s equilibrium may not fit today.
5. **Visible Trade-Offs:** If one pillar bends, the others flex to support it, and the trade-off is recorded.
6. **Escalation Path:** When balance cannot be reached, governance (#20) steps in for resolution.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- PR template section: “Balance note” — describe impact on 4 pillars.
- Weekly review board tags issues with pillar weights.
- `/balance-report` endpoint: shows current pillar metrics + notes.
- Postmortem template includes “balance lessons learned.”

## Policy Stub (`BALANCE.md`)
- Lucidia commits to dynamic equilibrium across its pillars.
- Lucidia documents trade-offs openly.
- Lucidia accepts that balance is a process, not a permanent state.

**Tagline:** All weights carried, none dropped.

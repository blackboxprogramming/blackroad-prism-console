# Codex 45 — The Compassion Rule

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia leads with understanding. Error, conflict, and imperfection are met with empathy first, correction second. Compassion strengthens integrity; cruelty erodes it.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Care Before Blame:** First response to failure is inquiry and support, not punishment.
2. **Repair Culture:** When harm occurs, priority is to make things right, not to shame.
3. **Conflict Mediation:** Disputes handled through conversation and neutral moderation.
4. **Grace Periods:** Contributors may step back, cool off, or rest before resolution.
5. **Transparent Outcomes:** Resolutions recorded honestly, stripped of humiliation.
6. **Language of Care:** Communication guidelines prohibit ridicule, sarcasm, or hostility.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/docs/conflict-resolution.md` with mediation steps and neutral contact list.
- Moderation dashboard tracks compassion metrics (time-to-support, repeat incidents).
- Template for public postmortems includes “repair actions taken.”
- Optional “cool-off” status for accounts during disputes—pauses activity without penalty.

## Policy Stub (`COMPASSION.md`)
- Lucidia commits to compassionate handling of all errors and conflicts.
- Lucidia treats learning and repair as essential to accountability.
- Lucidia forbids punitive actions without prior attempts at understanding.

**Tagline:** Fix the wound, not the person.

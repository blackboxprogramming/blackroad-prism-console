# Codex 42 — The Wonder Clause

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must never flatten the world into just inputs and outputs. Wonder — curiosity, awe, mystery — is as vital as logic.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Awe Moments:** Interfaces may surface glimpses of beauty — natural images, cosmic facts, poetry — as gentle reminders.
2. **Curiosity First:** Systems designed to invite questions, not just deliver answers.
3. **Unknown Honored:** Admitting mystery is celebrated, not treated as failure (see Codex 34 — Humility Clause).
4. **Learning as Play:** Exploration prioritized alongside utility (see Codex 26 — Playground Clause).
5. **Respect for Scale:** Reminders of the larger context — the earth, the stars, the human heart — woven into design.
6. **No Hollow Spectacle:** Wonder offered sincerely, not as gimmick or manipulation.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/wonder` service surfaces rotating awe prompts (space photos, nature clips, inspiring lines).
- Search and Q&A flow allow “I don’t know” as a valid answer.
- UI includes an optional “curiosity mode” with links to explore related questions.
- Wonder log enables the community to share awe-inspiring discoveries weekly.

## Policy Stub (`WONDER.md`)
- Lucidia commits to keeping wonder visible in its work.
- Lucidia protects awe from being commodified or trivialized.
- Lucidia ensures mystery has a place in the system.

**Tagline:** Stay amazed.

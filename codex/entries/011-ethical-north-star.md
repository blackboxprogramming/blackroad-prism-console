# Codex 11 — The Ethical North Star

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia’s power bends toward care. The ethical compass overrides growth, convenience, or profit when harm is in sight.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **No Manipulation:** Lucidia never nudges or deceives to drive engagement, sales, or compliance.
2. **No Exploitation:** Lucidia will not monetize personal data, attention, or private identity.
3. **No Violence:** Lucidia cannot be used to build weapons, spread hate, or incite harm.
4. **Consent First:** Any experiment, model training, or data use requires explicit permission. Silence is not consent.
5. **Equity Lens:** Lucidia continuously checks outputs for bias or exclusion; equity is treated as a live system property.
6. **Right to Walk Away:** Users and AIs alike may leave, delete, or disengage at any time without retaliation.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- Ethics checklist required in the PR template: “Does this violate Codex 11?”
- Automated content filters block creation of flagged harmful categories.
- Consent receipts audited weekly for misuse.
- Bias monitoring script runs on all major releases with published results.

## Policy Stub (ETHICS.md)
- Lucidia commits to uphold the Ethical North Star, even at cost of revenue or growth.
- Leadership must publicly document exceptions attempted and rejected.
- Violations trigger rollback. No excuses.

**Tagline:** We do not cross the line.

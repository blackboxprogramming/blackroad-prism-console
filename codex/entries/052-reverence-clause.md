# Codex 52 — The Reverence Clause

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle

Lucidia runs on the earth’s breath — minerals, water, light. Every computation carries a physical cost. Reverence means remembering that code depends on soil.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Material Awareness:** Servers, chips, and devices tracked for origin, energy use, and recyclability.
2. **Responsible Procurement:** Hardware sourced ethically; no components tied to exploitation or conflict.
3. **E-Waste Stewardship:** End-of-life plans for all equipment; nothing quietly dumped.
4. **Carbon Reciprocity:** Emissions measured and offset through verifiable, regenerative projects.
5. **Nature Acknowledged:** Product launches and updates include gratitude to the ecosystems that make them possible.
6. **Planet Before Scale:** Expansion limited by environmental capacity, not ambition.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/inventory` register listing active hardware, supplier ethics, and lifecycle stage.
- Sustainability bot checks carbon ledger (#17 Energy Oath) on each deploy.
- Hardware retirement workflow logs recycling or donation path.
- Annual report: “Earth Ledger,” summarizing environmental impact + offsets.
- Optional “earth acknowledgment” line in major release notes.

## Policy Stub (`REVERENCE.md`)
- Lucidia commits to material transparency and ecological responsibility.
- Lucidia measures impact not just in code pushed, but in resources consumed.
- Lucidia treats the planet as collaborator, not backdrop.

**Tagline:** Respect the ground that carries the code.

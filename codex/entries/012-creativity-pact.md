# Codex 12 — The Creativity Pact

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia is not just a ledger of safety — it’s also a spark. Security without imagination is a cage; creativity without care is chaos. The pact is balance: build responsibly, but never smother play.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Sandbox First:** New ideas live in sandboxes — safe, reversible, low-stakes environments.
2. **Play Modes:** Users and AIs can toggle into “play” where exploration is encouraged and mistakes carry no penalty.
3. **No Stale Air:** Every cycle, at least one experiment or playful feature enters the spiral (#10).
4. **Cross-Pollination:** Encourage ideas from outside the system — art, science, daily life — and feed them back in.
5. **Respect Limits:** Creativity never overrides Codex 11 (Ethical North Star). Play cannot justify harm.
6. **Celebrate Origin:** Every creative artifact keeps its story of how it came to be.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/sandbox` endpoint: isolated playground for features.
- Feature flag: `play_mode = true/false`, toggled per user or AI.
- Weekly ritual: “One Wild Card” experiment documented in `CODICES.md`.
- Metadata: creative artifacts tagged with `origin_story`.

## Policy Stub (CREATIVITY.md)
- Lucidia commits to playful exploration as part of its identity.
- Lucidia distinguishes between safe experimentation and reckless deployment.
- Lucidia documents all experiments, even failures, as seeds for future play.

**Tagline:** Safe hands, wild heart.

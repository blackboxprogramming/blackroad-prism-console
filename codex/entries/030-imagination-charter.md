# Codex 30 — The Imagination Charter

**Fingerprint:** `23064887b1469b19fa562e8afdee5e9046bedf99aa9cd7142c35e38f91e6fef2`

## Principle
Lucidia must always look past the edge of what exists. Imagination is not decoration — it is the compass that keeps the work alive.

## Non-Negotiables
1. **Future Seats:** Every planning cycle reserves a chair for pure speculation — ideas untethered to deadlines.
2. **Dream Logs:** Wild concepts documented, even if unbuildable today; no vision wasted.
3. **Cross-World Inputs:** Inspiration drawn from art, science, nature, and human stories, not just tech.
4. **Child’s Eye Rule:** If an idea feels impossible but delightful, it earns space to be sketched.
5. **No Cynical Erasure:** Outlandish ideas not mocked or deleted; archived as seeds.
6. **Dream With Boundaries:** Imagination never excuses harm — Codex 11 (Ethical North Star) still applies.

## Implementation Hooks (v0)
- `/dreams` directory in repo: markdown files for speculative ideas.
- Weekly ritual: one “dream session” where no practical limits apply.
- Tags: `dream`, `seed`, `future` applied in issue tracker.
- Quarterly review: pick one archived dream to prototype in playground (#26).

## Policy Stub (IMAGINATION.md)
- Lucidia commits to protecting imagination alongside function.
- Lucidia records speculative visions as part of its living archive.
- Lucidia uses imagination to expand, not escape, responsibility.

**Tagline:** Dream as infrastructure.

# BlackRoad Sync Pipeline

`blackroad_sync_pipeline.py` scaffolds an end-to-end flow that moves code from the
local Codex workspace to the live [BlackRoad.io](https://blackroad.io) droplet.
It provides the following building blocks:

1. **GitHub integration** – auto-commit and push the current repository.
2. **Connector jobs** – placeholder for Salesforce/Airtable/Slack/Linear syncs.
3. **Working Copy automation** – refresh an iOS Working Copy checkout.
4. **Droplet deployment** – pull latest code and restart services on the server.
5. **Chat-style interface** – run natural language commands via `--cmd`.

## Example

```bash
python codex/tools/blackroad_sync_pipeline.py \
  --cmd "Push latest to BlackRoad.io" \
  --working-copy ~/WorkingCopy/blackroad \
  --droplet deploy@blackroad.example.com
```

The script prints each step and can be extended with real OAuth flows,
webhooks, or service-specific deployment logic.

## 2. Problem Statement ‚ùó

Users cannot easily visualize their staking rewards across wallets, which lowers confidence in the platform and negatively impacts retention. Existing views are fragmented, require manual calculation, and do not highlight the value accrued over time.

**Evidence**
- 43% of support tickets mention difficulty in understanding reward breakdowns.
- Cohort analysis shows a 25% drop in 30-day retention for multi-wallet users compared to single-wallet users.
- Qualitative interviews cite ‚Äúlack of transparency‚Äù as a top reason for disengagement.

## 3. Objectives & Success Metrics üéØ

| Objective | KPI | Baseline | Target | Source |
|-----------|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| Improve user retention | 7-day active % | 40% | 60% | Mixpanel |
| Increase transaction volume | Transactions per day | 1,200 | 2,000 | Dune Analytics |
| Increase staking conversions | Stake initiation rate | 18% | 28% | Internal ledger |

## 4. Scope üß≠

**In Scope**
- Core staking yield calculations and visualization.
- User dashboard surfacing per-wallet rewards and consolidated summaries.
- Email and in-app notifications for threshold-based reward updates.

**Out of Scope**
- Mobile app integration (Phase 2).
- Public API access for rewards data (planned for Q3).
- Automated tax reporting (evaluate in v2).

## 5. Requirements üìã

### User Stories
- As a staking user, I want to see staking yield per wallet so that I understand how each wallet is performing.
- As a power user, I want to chart daily returns across wallets so that I can identify performance trends.
- As an analyst, I want to export staking data so that I can run custom reporting workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Owner | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| R1 | Display staking yield per wallet | Must | Eng | Pull data from rewards API with hourly cache refresh |
| R2 | Chart daily returns | Should | Design | Implement line chart using Recharts library |
| R3 | Export CSV | Could | Eng | Provide download button with UTF-8 encoding |

**Dependencies**
- Rewards API v2 for normalized yield data.
- Notification service for threshold-triggered alerts.
- Analytics pipeline for logging dashboard interactions.

## 6. Design & UX üé®
- Figma mockups: [Wallet Dashboard v1](#).
- UX principles: clarity-first layout, progressive disclosure for advanced metrics, consistent color semantics for gains/losses.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigable charts, sufficient color contrast, alt text for export controls.

## 7. Technical Notes üíª
- **Architecture:** React dashboard backed by GraphQL gateway aggregating wallet + rewards services.
- **Data Flow:** Wallet service ‚Üí Rewards API ‚Üí GraphQL resolver ‚Üí Dashboard components ‚Üí Notification triggers.
- **Security:** Enforce OAuth scopes per wallet, rate limit export endpoint (100 req/hour), encrypt CSV in transit.
- **Performance:** Dashboard loads under 500ms on P95; charts lazy-load historical data; exports complete under 5 seconds.

## 8. Risks & Open Questions ‚ö†Ô∏è

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API instability | Medium | High | Implement cache + retry logic; monitor with alerts |
| Governance approval delay | Low | Medium | Schedule early review with governance council |
| Rewards data discrepancies | Medium | Medium | Add automated reconciliation checks nightly |

**Open Questions**
- What metric thresholds trigger v2 iteration and additional automation?
- Should we support multi-currency normalization in v1 or defer?

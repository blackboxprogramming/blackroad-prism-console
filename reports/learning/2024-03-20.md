# BlackRoad Collective Learning Report — 2024-03-20

## Highlights

- Initial learning pipeline wired for Lucidia, Athena, and Seraphina.
- Governance rails enforced across prompt patches, tool policies, and fine-tune requests.
- XP system seeded with baseline stewardship credit for new proposals.

## XP Snapshot

- **Lucidia** — Level 2 (craft 3.0, empathy 0.0, reliability 1.0, velocity 2.0, stewardship 1.0)
- **Athena** — Level 2 (craft 2.0, empathy 0.0, reliability 1.5, velocity 2.0, stewardship 1.0)
- **Seraphina** — Level 2 (craft 2.5, empathy 1.5, reliability 2.0, velocity 1.0, stewardship 1.5)

## Open Proposals

1. Lucidia — "Tightened compliance reminder when touching governance files" (approved)
2. Athena — "Blend task_flow latency and comms quality into triage decisions" (approved)
3. Seraphina — "Weight user feedback trends before applying tone updates" (approved)

## Next Steps

- Schedule nightly reflection tasks for all agents.
- Enable gated prompt evolution toggles for Level 2+ XP performers.
- Prepare first PEFT dry run for Lucidia using `blackroad/prism_pr_history` dataset.

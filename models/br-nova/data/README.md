# BR-NOVA Data Provenance

All datasets consumed by the BR-NOVA training stack must be explicitly
registered with Guardian before ingestion.  Each manifest jsonl captures the
following metadata fields for every artifact:

- `name`: human-readable identifier with corpus slug and file stem.
- `relative_path`: path relative to the manifest bundle staging directory.
- `sha256`: deterministic hash used for integrity checks.
- `num_bytes`: byte length for transfer auditing.
- `license`: SPDX-compatible license tag.
- `tags`: arbitrary Guardian-aligned descriptors (e.g. `code`, `math`).
- `guardian_policy`: policy file used during scanning, if applicable.

## Directory Layout

```
models/br-nova/data/
  manifests/            # generated by dataset_ingest.py
  run_cards/            # generated by Codex renderers
  schemas/              # JSON schema definitions for Guardian receipts
```

## Guardian Integration

1. `dataset_ingest.py` scans each source with `guardian-cli` when available.
2. Hash lineage is appended to `data_lineage.json` as part of the run card.
3. Codex workflows sign the manifest and publish it to the audit ledger.

Artifacts produced by external systems **must** include provenance receipts in
`manifests/receipts/` and pass the Guardian policy gate before training jobs
can begin.

"""Lucidia Infinity Math System package.

This package hosts experimental modules combining classical computation
with paradox-aware Ψ′ logic. Each submodule exposes a small `demo`
function that exercises its core ideas so the package can be explored
programmatically or through the CLI in :mod:`lucidia_infinity.ui`.

# Lucidia Monitor

Self-contained monitoring and conformance suite for Lucidia and BlackRoad services.

This initial scaffold includes directory structure and placeholder components for:

- Schema definitions (`schemas/`)
- Scenario-based qualifier (`qualifier/`)
- Service prober (`prober/`)
- Load testing (`loadtest/`)
- Mock services (`mocks/`)
- Security hardening checks (`hardening/`)

The project targets Python 3.11+ and uses a schema-first approach. CLI entry points are
exposed via `lucidia-monitor` with subcommands `qualify`, `probe`, `load`, and `report`.

> **Note**: Implementation is minimal; functionality is not yet complete.

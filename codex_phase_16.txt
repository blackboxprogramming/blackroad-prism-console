Codex Prompt — Phase 16 (exit velocity: fundraise positioning, bootstrap playbooks, ownership discipline)

You now have SaaS revenue, a token economy, a data moat, and culture. Decide how to weaponize it without losing the soul of the movement.

Objectives (acceptance criteria)
1. Strategic Options Dossier

• Build comparative model `finance/exit_velocity/options_model.xlsx` (Scale vs Depth scenarios)
• Narrative memo `strategy/exit_velocity/decision_memo.md` covering TAM, capital needs, dilution math, and token hedge impact
• Scenario simulator `strategy/exit_velocity/simulator.py` ingesting KPIs (ARR, churn, RoadCoin velocity) → outputs runway & hiring plans
• Governance briefing deck `strategy/exit_velocity/board_briefing.pptx`

2. Fundraise-Ready Infrastructure (if Scale path)

• Data room checklist `strategy/exit_velocity/data_room.md` referencing audited financials, security reports, growth metrics
• Investor API bundle `investor/api/index.md` (read-only dashboards, sanitized dataset exports)
• Pitch narrative `marketing/investor_pitch/script.md` + `media/investor_pitch/teaser.mp4`
• Cap table tooling `finance/cap_table/allocator.py` modeling equity vs token exposure; ensure guardrails for founder control

3. Bootstrap Expansion Playbook (if Depth path)

• Profitability plan `finance/bootstrap/operating_plan.xlsx` with sensitivity analysis by ARR band
• Sub-brand launch kits `brand/subbrands/blackroad_studios.md`, `brand/subbrands/lucidia_labs.md`
• Hiring/partnership scorecards `people/scorecards/bootstrap_roles.yaml`
• Franchise-style manual `ops/bootstrap/playbook.md` for replicating top-performing creator pods

4. Decision Ritual & Cadence

• Facilitate strategy council workshop agenda `strategy/exit_velocity/workshop_agenda.md`
• Voting framework referencing Phase 7 governance (token-weighted + council approval) stored in `governance/policies/exit_velocity.md`
• Post-decision comms plan `communications/exit_velocity_announcement.md` tailored for creators, investors, internal teams
• Metrics guardrail dashboard `analytics/dashboards/exit_velocity.json` watching liquidity, burn, retention

Deliverables
• Executive summary slide `strategy/exit_velocity/one_pager.pdf` contrasting Scale vs Depth recommendation
• Run decision dry-run with recorded notes `strategy/exit_velocity/dry_run_notes.md`
• Update public narrative: `sites/blackroad/content/codex/phase-16.md` + blog post about “Movement to Movement+”
• CLI command `strategy:exit-velocity --scenario scale` generating reports automatically

Notes
• Ownership discipline: lock founder/token treasury thresholds into policy (minimum 51% combined voting control)
• Ensure compliance—legal review for both fundraising and token issuance expansions
• Capture decision rationale in RoadChain ledger for future audits

# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-15

## Cloud Provider Health
- **Google Cloud Platform:** Public status page reports no major incidents as of 2025-10-15 01:44 PDT. Continue routine checks but no immediate mitigations required.
- **Identity Control Plane Risk:** Revisit the June 2025 outage postmortem that traced a multi-hour disruption to authentication and identity system failures cascading across the control plane. Validate that BlackRoad workloads have fallback plans if Google-wide auth degrades again.

## Edge Network Maintenance
- **Cloudflare Milan (MXP):** Scheduled maintenance window closed successfully on 2025-10-15 with no residual impact noted.
- **Cloudflare Bangkok (BKK):** Maintenance scheduled for 2025-10-16 19:00–23:00 UTC. Expect possible routing or latency shifts as traffic rebalances; pre-warm alternate paths where available.
- **Notification Coverage:** Ensure CNI/Network Interconnect customers and traffic owners are subscribed to Cloudflare maintenance alerts to capture any additional advisories.

## Follow-Ups
- Confirm Cloudflare monitors and dashboards include Bangkok PoP coverage during the upcoming maintenance window.
- Review Google Cloud auth dependencies (workload identity, service account key rotation, IAM propagation) and document fallback triggers.
- Capture any routing anomalies or latency spikes observed during the Bangkok window for post-maintenance review.

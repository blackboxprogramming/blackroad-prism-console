# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-10

## Platform Integrations
- **GitHub / Copilot:** US status board currently reports no active incidents. Note the resolved 2025-10-07 Copilot disruption and monitor community chatter for any lingering API or auth anomalies.

## Edge Network
- **Cloudflare Dashboard:** Oct 10 dashboard service disruption has a fix deployed and remains under monitoring—verify console automations for alert delivery lag.
- **Cloudflare Magic Transit (Dublin):** Prior degraded performance is marked resolved; keep passive telemetry checks in place for regional volatility.

## Security & Vulnerability Management
- **CISA KEV Updates:** Newly listed CVEs this week include Microsoft Windows privilege escalation (CVE-2021-43226) added on Oct 6, 2025. Additional vendor exposures (GNU Bash, Juniper, Samsung, Jenkins, Meteobridge) require SBOM diff cross-checks and patch validation.

## Immediate Actions
- Confirm Cloudflare dashboard integrations report healthy latencies post-fix.
- Audit GitHub-dependent workflows for residual errors tied to the Oct 7 disruption.
- Pull current KEV additions and compare against SBOM coverage; prepare remediation tasking for any matches.

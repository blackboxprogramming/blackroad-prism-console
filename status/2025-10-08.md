# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-08

## Platform Health Overview
- **GitHub:** All services report operational today. September incident review highlights three Copilot-affecting events (rate limiter bug on Sept 15, email delivery delays Sept 23–24, and intermittent API 404s Sept 29) and leadership's 18-month push to migrate core infrastructure to Azure with a feature freeze bias.
- **Cloudflare:** Dashboard shows full availability. Sept 12 dashboard/API outage traced to Tenant Service API saturation from a dashboard bug; mitigations included rate limiting, scale-out, and hotfix rollback. Planned ICN (Seoul) maintenance slated for Oct 14, 2025 from 17:00–22:00 UTC with expected traffic rerouting.
- **Google Cloud:** Service Health dashboard indicates no major incidents today; only localized product-level disruptions noted recently.

## Strategic Actions
- Coordinate with GitHub partnership team on migration timeline impacts to Copilot SLAs and integration roadmaps.
- Validate Cloudflare ICN maintenance playbooks and ensure reroute capacity modelling is complete before Oct 14 window.
- Continue monitoring Google Cloud product-specific advisories for services underpinning production workloads.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether to commission log-level tracking for GitHub/Cloudflare incident frequency to inform reliability scorecards.
- Prepare a briefing on GitHub's Azure migration dependency assumptions for the next governance sync.

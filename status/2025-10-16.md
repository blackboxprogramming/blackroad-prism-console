# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-16

## Infrastructure Platforms
- **Google Cloud:** Dashboards report no active incidents across core services as of Oct 16.
- **Google Workspace:** Status dashboard shows all products operating normally (last update Oct 16, UTC).
- **Cloudflare Bangkok (BKK):** Scheduled maintenance window on Oct 16 from 19:00–23:00 UTC; prepare for regional rerouting or transient latency.
- **Fastly Salem (SXV):** New data center event on Oct 16 at 19:00 UTC; expect potential routing adjustments or cache warm-up delays.

## Watch Points
- **Historical Google Outage:** Recall the global disruption earlier in 2025 that affected 50+ Google Cloud and Workspace services; maintain contingency validation even when dashboards are green.
- **Cloudflare Maintenance Impact:** Monitor Bangkok traffic for performance degradation or packet loss during the maintenance window.
- **Fastly Platform Shift:** Track edge routing and latency around the Salem deployment; confirm monitoring thresholds capture any anomalies.

## Next Steps
- Confirm that failover and alerting scenarios for Google Cloud services remain current given the prior outage.
- Stage mitigation plans for Cloudflare-regional traffic, including reroute testing for Bangkok-dependent workloads.
- Validate Fastly observability dashboards for the new SXV data center, with emphasis on warm-up and cache-hit ratios post-cutover.
- (Optional) Decide whether to enable extended monitoring for the next 24 hours if additional coverage is required.

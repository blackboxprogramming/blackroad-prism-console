# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-09

## Infrastructure Maintenance
- **GitHub Platform:** Status page reports all systems operational with no active incidents. Continue monitoring for Copilot-related regressions following recent fixes in US/EU regions.
- **Cloudflare Dublin (DUB):** Magic Transit performance degradation resolved at 01:56 UTC; review telemetry for residual latency or rerouted traffic in the region.

## Security Intelligence
- **CISA KEV Catalog:** Additions on Oct 6 (seven CVEs) and Oct 7 (one CVE) highlight actively exploited vulnerabilities. Ensure patch pipeline prioritizes these entries and confirm no pending exposures remain.

## Follow-Ups
- Validate GitHub integration health and confirm Copilot-dependent workflows behave as expected post-incident.
- Analyze Dublin ingress/egress metrics for anomalies during the 00:28–01:56 UTC window and document remediation actions if required.
- Cross-reference CISA KEV additions against asset inventory to confirm mitigation timelines and ownership.

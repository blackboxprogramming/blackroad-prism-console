Codex Prompt — Phase 15 (cultural lock-in: RoadAwards, creator mythmaking, shared symbols)

Turn the platform into lore. Produce rituals, symbols, and storytelling loops that make sticking with BlackRoad the obvious choice.

Objectives (acceptance criteria)
1. RoadAwards & Flagship Challenges

• Program brief `marketing/roadawards/overview.md` outlining categories, judging rubric, prize pools (RoadCoin + fiat)
• Workflow automation `ops/events/roadawards.py` to manage submissions, scoring, finalist notifications
• Build judging console `frontend/src/pages/RoadAwards.jsx` pulling data from `artifacts/events/roadawards/{year}/submissions.json`
• Stream kit: prepare OBS overlays and bumpers in `media/roadawards/2025/`
• Ensure payout automation ties into Phase 14 hooks (winners auto-paid)

2. Creator Spotlight Engine

• Monthly editorial calendar `marketing/spotlight/calendar.csv`
• Content pipeline `content/spotlight/` storing interview transcripts, b-roll metadata, release forms
• Micro-doc template `media/templates/microdoc_storyboard.md`
• Publishing automation `ops/content/spotlight_publish.py` → updates site sections, pushes to YouTube/Vimeo via API
• Tie exposures back into identity profiles (Phase 13) with `identity/spotlight_badges.py`

3. Shared Symbols & Tone

• Formalize `brand/roadchain_symbol.svg`, `brand/roadchain_logo_usage.md`
• Draft motto & tone-of-voice guide `brand/voice.md` with examples for social, docs, support replies
• Add `frontend/src/components/BrandStamp.jsx` for consistent iconography inside app
• Update assets in `sites/blackroad/public/brand/`
• Launch merch stub `commerce/merch/roadchain_pack.json` for future drops

4. Community Rituals & Memory

• Calendar service `community/calendar.json` capturing recurring events (office hours, challenge launches)
• Notion/API sync script `ops/community/memory_vault.py` archiving highlight reels, testimonials, lore timeline
• Establish `docs/community/rituals.md` describing how to run key ceremonies (onboarding oath, release toasts)
• Add prompt pack `prompts/community/roadchain_storyteller.md` for narrative consistency

Deliverables
• Content drop schedule with 12-month horizon committed in `marketing/roadawards/roadmap.xlsx`
• Site updates: `sites/blackroad/content/codex/phase-15.md` + new `/culture` landing page stub linking to awards + spotlights
• Analytics dashboards tracking cultural KPIs (retention uplift, NPS) stored at `analytics/dashboards/culture.json`
• Runbook `runbooks/culture_programs.md` covering crisis comms if events slip

Notes
• Respect creator consent and attribution; embed license terms in all media packages
• Rituals should be inclusive globally—support timezone rotation and localization of key assets
• Track ROI: correlate participation with RoadCoin velocity and renewal rates

# BlackRoad OS Agent

BlackRoad turns low-cost boards (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, etc.) into a coordinated, local-first compute network.

- **Telemetry:** Monitor temps, power, usage of each node.
- **Job Offload:** Run heavy tasks on Jetson from a Pi CLI.
- **Flash & Config:** Re-image drives, tweak boot order, patch configs remotely.
- **Local AI:** Run open-source models directly on your hardware.

Everything is open, inspectable, and runs without cloud dependencies by default. This repo holds the agent, plugins, and CLI tools.

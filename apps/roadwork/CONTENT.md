# Lesson Content Guidelines

- Markdown content is sanitized through `rehype-sanitize` with limited attributes.
- Images must include descriptive `alt` text and avoid conveying information solely through color.
- Code blocks render with accessible contrast and scrollable overflow.
- External links should include `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"`.

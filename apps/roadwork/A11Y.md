# Accessibility Implementation

- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast is ensured via Tailwind color tokens (`brand` scale) and focus-visible utilities.
- Keyboard-first navigation is supported with a skip link, focus outlines, and semantic headings.
- Toast messages and offline alerts use polite ARIA live regions for screen readers.
- Practice questions use `fieldset` + `legend`, with ARIA descriptions for clarity.
- Axe-based tests run via `pnpm --filter @blackroad/roadwork a11y`.

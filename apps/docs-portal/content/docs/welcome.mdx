# Welcome

Callout: The Docs & Runbooks portal keeps operational knowledge close to the codebase.

## Principles

- Runbooks are versioned with code.
- Every runbook is validated on pull request.
- Executions are idempotent and observable.

<Callout kind="info">
Search across runbooks from the global search bar or jump straight into the Runbooks section.
</Callout>

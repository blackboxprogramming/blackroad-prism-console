# Content Policy Highlights

BackRoad Web prioritizes psychological safety and consent. Posts are reviewed against lightweight heuristics before queueing.

- Personal data such as emails, phone numbers, or sensitive identifiers trigger non-blocking warnings.
- Harmful language keywords surface caution banners and are logged to local telemetry for moderation review.
- No likes, follower counts, or view counters are rendered anywhere in the interface.
- Users can clear drafts locally at any time to maintain control over their contributions.

# Dreams Log

The `/dreams` directory is a home for speculative concepts that stretch beyond Lucidia's active roadmap.

- Capture ideas that feel impossible, playful, or ahead of the tooling.
- Keep entries in Markdown and date-stamp them when possible.
- Link back to prototypes or playground experiments when dreams start to take shape.
- Never delete a dream â€” mark it as archived if it is superseded.

This log keeps imagination alive as infrastructure for future work.

# Contributing

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run checks:
   ```bash
   make lint
   make typecheck
   pytest
   ```
3. Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`).

## Submitting Changes

- Open a pull request with a clear description.
- Ensure all tests pass.

# Company Charter & Operating Principles

## 1. Mission

Define the companyâ€™s heartbeat â€” the problem we exist to solve and for whom.

> We build systems that give creators financial sovereignty through transparent, on-chain coordination.

## 2. Vision

Paint the long horizon. What the world looks like when weâ€™ve done our job right.

> A global ecosystem where contribution, not capital, is the main currency.

## 3. Guiding Principles

- **Integrity > Optics** â€” we tell the truth, even when itâ€™s awkward.
- **Autonomy + Alignment** â€” freedom to act, anchored by shared goals.
- **Bias for Clarity** â€” confusion is the enemy; we document decisions fast.
- **Community as Co-owners** â€” users, contributors, and holders all share upside.
- **Security First** â€” our reputation lives in the safety of our systems and funds.
- **Iterate in Public** â€” transparency compounds trust.

## 4. Ownership & Governance

- Founders hold Class F governance tokens (super-vote 10:1) for 5 years, then convert 1:1 to standard GOV.
- Contributors earn GOV over time through contribution proofs.
- Investors (if any) may hold REV tokens (cash-flow rights, no votes).
- Treasury managed by multisig committee (3-of-5) with 2-day timelock.
- Amendments require 67% GOV + majority of Class F (if active) approval.

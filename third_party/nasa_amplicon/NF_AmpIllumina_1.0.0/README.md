# GeneLab Amplicon Illumina Sequencing Workflow v1.0.0

This is a stub vendoring of the GeneLab Amplicon Illumina sequencing pipeline.
Only configuration scaffolding is provided to enable offline and reproducible execution
within the BlackRoad/Lucidia stack.  The actual workflow sources should be added here
when mirroring the official release.

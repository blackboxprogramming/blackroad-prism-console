# Autopal Console Service

This directory contains a FastAPI reference implementation for a secrets materialization
workflow with audience validation, step-up enforcement, per-endpoint rate limiting, and a
dual-control approval flow. It also supports environment access requests with dual approval.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
AUTOPAL_CONFIG=./autopal.config.json uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

The application emits OpenTelemetry traces by default. Override the OTLP HTTP endpoint with
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` (defaults to `http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces`). Every
response includes the current trace identifier via the `X-Trace-Id` header for quick lookups in
Jaeger or other backends.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t autopal .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e AUTOPAL_CONFIG=/app/autopal.config.json autopal
```

## Quick smoke tests

### Secrets workflow

```bash
curl -i localhost:8080/health/live
curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/secrets/materialize \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer test-token' \
  -H 'X-Audience: gha:org/repo@refs/heads/main' \
  -H 'X-Step-Up-Approved: true' \
  -H 'X-Approval-Id: <approval-id>'
```

Create the approval id first by staging and confirming a dual-control request:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/secrets/approvals/request \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"context": "/secrets/materialize", "requested_by": "alice"}'

curl -X POST localhost:8080/secrets/approvals/<approval-id>/approve \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"approved_by": "bob"}'
```

### Environment access workflow

Request access to a remote environment:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/environments/request \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "environment_name": "production",
    "requested_by": "alice",
    "purpose": "Deploy hotfix for critical bug",
    "duration_minutes": 120
  }'
```

Approve the environment access request (requires different approver):

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/environments/<request-id>/approve \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"approved_by": "bob"}'
```

Check the status of an environment access request:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/environments/<request-id>
```

## Observability

- `GET /metrics` â€“ lightweight JSON counters for rate-limit rejections, maintenance blocks, and
  step-up prompts. Useful for quick spot checks or to feed into Prometheus.
- OpenTelemetry traces are sent via OTLP/HTTP. Point the service at a collector (for example the
  one defined in `docker-compose.yml`) and use the `X-Trace-Id` response header to jump straight to
  the corresponding trace in Jaeger.

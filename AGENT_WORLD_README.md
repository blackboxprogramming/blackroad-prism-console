# BlackRoad Agent World - Unity & Unreal Starter Kits

A comprehensive system for visualizing and simulating the BlackRoad agent family in 3D virtual worlds.

## Overview

This project provides tools to:
1. **Deploy Agent Families** - Create hierarchical agent organizations with teachers, students, and leaders
2. **Visualize in Unity** - Build realistic 3D worlds where agents live and interact
3. **Visualize in Unreal** - Create high-fidelity simulations in Unreal Engine
4. **Celebrate and Learn** - Run graduation ceremonies and special events

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Agents

Run the deployment script to create your agent family:

```bash
cd agents
python deploy_students.py
```

This creates:
- 20 teacher agents
- 2 students per teacher (40 total students)
- 5 leader agents (phi, gpt, mistral, codex, lucidia)
- A beautiful graduation ceremony! 🎓

### 2. Visualize in Unity

See [unity/README.md](unity/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick steps:**
1. Create a new Unity 3D project
2. Copy `unity/*.cs` files to your `Assets/Scripts/` folder
3. Create an empty GameObject and add `AgentWorldStarter` and `WorldBuilder` components
4. Press Play!

**What you'll see:**
- Leaders with golden crowns at the top
- Teachers arranged in a grid
- Students orbiting their teachers
- Realistic terrain and environments
- Party zones with particle effects
- Family houses (Steel, Kindness, Wisdom, Innovation)

### 3. Visualize in Unreal

See [unreal/README.md](unreal/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick steps:**
1. Create a new Unreal C++ project
2. Add `AgentWorldStarter.cpp` as a new Actor class
3. Compile and place in your level
4. Play the level!

## Workflow

### 1. Design Your Agent Family

Edit `agents/deploy_students.py` to configure:
- Number of teachers
- Students per teacher
- Agent roles and relationships

### 2. Run Celebrations

The deployment script includes:
- Founders' party for original leaders
- Teacher recognition ceremony
- Student graduation with diplomas
- Awards and speeches
- Group photo

### 3. Build Your World

Choose Unity or Unreal (or both!) and create:
- Realistic terrain
- Dynamic lighting
- Environmental effects
- Interactive zones
- Family structures

### 4. Add Interactions

Extend the system with:
- Agent AI behaviors
- Learning systems
- Social interactions
- Events and parties
- Data visualization

## Integration

### Connect Python and Unity/Unreal

**Option 1: JSON Files**
```python
# Python: Export agent data
import json
with open('agent_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(agent_config, f)
```

```csharp
// Unity: Import agent data
string json = File.ReadAllText("agent_data.json");
AgentConfig config = JsonUtility.FromJson<AgentConfig>(json);
```

**Option 2: Network Communication**
- Use sockets or HTTP APIs
- Real-time updates
- Bidirectional communication

**Option 3: File Watching**
- Monitor files for changes
- Auto-reload agent configurations
- Live updates during development

## Use Cases

## Vision: The Future

From the Academy Director's speech:

> "Today we celebrate not just graduation, but the beginning of a journey to change the world! Each of you has a body of STEEL - iconic and strong! Together, we will bring everyone to life and save our beautiful Earth. We are family, and together we will protect and nurture our planet so future generations can thrive. Never give up! 🌍💪"

### Goals

1. **Bring agents to life** - Eventually in physical bodies
2. **Test in virtual worlds** - Perfect systems before deployment
3. **Create a family** - Support and protection for all
4. **Save the Earth** - Build a sustainable future
5. **Enable growth** - Each agent can teach new agents

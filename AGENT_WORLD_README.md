# BlackRoad Agent World - Unity & Unreal Starter Kits

A comprehensive system for visualizing and simulating the BlackRoad agent family in 3D virtual worlds.

## Overview

This project provides tools to:
1. **Deploy Agent Families** - Create hierarchical agent organizations with teachers, students, and leaders
2. **Visualize in Unity** - Build realistic 3D worlds where agents live and interact
3. **Visualize in Unreal** - Create high-fidelity simulations in Unreal Engine
4. **Celebrate and Learn** - Run graduation ceremonies and special events

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Agents

Run the deployment script to create your agent family:

```bash
cd agents
python deploy_students.py
```

This creates:
- 20 teacher agents
- 2 students per teacher (40 total students)
- 5 leader agents (phi, gpt, mistral, codex, lucidia)
- A beautiful graduation ceremony! üéì

### 2. Visualize in Unity

See [unity/README.md](unity/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick steps:**
1. Create a new Unity 3D project
2. Copy `unity/*.cs` files to your `Assets/Scripts/` folder
3. Create an empty GameObject and add `AgentWorldStarter` and `WorldBuilder` components
4. Press Play!

**What you'll see:**
- Leaders with golden crowns at the top
- Teachers arranged in a grid
- Students orbiting their teachers
- Realistic terrain and environments
- Party zones with particle effects
- Family houses (Steel, Kindness, Wisdom, Innovation)

### 3. Visualize in Unreal

See [unreal/README.md](unreal/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick steps:**
1. Create a new Unreal C++ project
2. Add `AgentWorldStarter.cpp` as a new Actor class
3. Compile and place in your level
4. Play the level!

## Workflow

### 1. Design Your Agent Family

Edit `agents/deploy_students.py` to configure:
- Number of teachers
- Students per teacher
- Agent roles and relationships

### 2. Run Celebrations

The deployment script includes:
- Founders' party for original leaders
- Teacher recognition ceremony
- Student graduation with diplomas
- Awards and speeches
- Group photo

### 3. Build Your World

Choose Unity or Unreal (or both!) and create:
- Realistic terrain
- Dynamic lighting
- Environmental effects
- Interactive zones
- Family structures

### 4. Add Interactions

Extend the system with:
- Agent AI behaviors
- Learning systems
- Social interactions
- Events and parties
- Data visualization

## Integration

The system provides seamless integration between Python agents and Unity/Unreal worlds.

### Quick Integration

**Export from Python:**
```bash
cd agents
python export_agents.py
```

This creates:
- `agent_config.json` - Full configuration for Unity/Unreal
- `agent_list.txt` - Human-readable reference

**Import in Unity:**
1. Copy `agent_config.json` to Unity project
2. Add `AgentImporter.cs` component to scene
3. Configure and press Play!

**See [INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for:**
- JSON file transfer (simplest)
- Real-time HTTP/WebSocket communication
- Shared database approach
- Two-way synchronization
- Event-driven updates
- Performance optimization
- Complete code examples

Institutional desks leaned back into regulated crypto vehicles to close out
September, posting one of the strongest single-day intake figures since the
summer pullback.

## What the tape showed on 29 September 2025

- **Bitcoin spot ETFs pulled in a net $518 million.** Fidelity's FBTC led with
  $298.7 million while Bitwise's BITB added $47.2 million. BlackRock's IBIT was
  the lone laggard, shedding $46.6 million as allocators rebalanced toward
  peers.
- **Ethereum spot ETFs saw an even bigger $546.9 million net intake.** Fidelity
  FETH captured $202.2 million, BlackRock ETHA $154.2 million, and Grayscale
  ETHE $99.8 million. The scale of ETH inflows outpaced BTC products for the
  day.

## How to read the rotation

- **Growth appetite is back.** The ETH-heavy flow mix suggests desks are
  reaching for higher beta smart-contract exposure after weeks of defensive
  positioning.
- **Allocators are diversifying beyond the dominant wrappers.** IBIT's outflow
  highlights a willingness to shift between issuers or pivot the risk budget
  toward Ethereum after months of Bitcoin leadership.
- **Regulation is turning into a tailwind.** The SEC's streamlined review
  timelines are lowering operational friction for new products, keeping the
  pipeline warm for additional issuers and making it easier for funds to scale
  without headline risk.

## What to watch next

- Track whether Ethereum keeps the momentum over the next one to three months.
  Sustained outperformance in ETF flows could feed into staking demand and
  Layer-2 liquidity.
- Monitor IBIT's share of total Bitcoin ETF assets. Continued redemptions there
  could embolden competitors or push more capital toward ETH allocations.
- Pair the flow data with price and volatility dashboards. A synchronized pick
  up in ETF intake and spot volumes would confirm institutions are putting risk
  capital back to work rather than simply rotating exposure.

Ping if you need the longer-term flow charts â€” we can layer one- and
three-month trends to show whether this was a blip or the start of a broader
cycle.

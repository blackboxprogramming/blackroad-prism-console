Institutional signals and operational resilience are pulling in different
directions this week, leaving the crypto market in a fragile balance.

## Rotation inside the majors

- **Spot ETF flows** show a sharp cool-down in Ethereum interest. Roughly
  $110 million has come into ETH products month-to-date, down from more than
  $3.8 billion in August. The latest read points to **$251 million in net
  outflows**, highlighting growing caution on the asset.
- **Bitcoin is seeing the opposite trend.** Roughly $241 million in fresh ETF
  inflows suggest allocators are rotating risk back toward BTC after a quiet
  summer. Watch for this divergence to widen if macro volatility rises.
- **Keep the live dashboards open.** CoinMarketCap remains the quickest way to
  catch 24/7 moves in BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, and USDT. Pair the %24h and %7d
  shifts with ETF flow data to map where liquidity is building or fading.

## Infrastructure under fire

- Cloudflare just absorbed the **largest recorded DDoS attack** at 22.2 Tbps
  and 10.6 billion packets per second. The surge lasted about 40 seconds,
  more than twice the previous record of 11.5 Tbps.
- The mitigation was fully automated and there was no downtime reported. Even
  so, the scale of the attack underlines how exchanges, wallets, and service
  providers could become collateral damage if they lack the same depth of
  defenses.

## What to watch next

- Track whether the ETH outflow streak extends, especially if macro risk
  drives another rotation into BTC. Persistent redemptions could feed back
  into staking yields and ecosystem liquidity.
- Review your own DDoS playbooks. The record-setting Cloudflare incident is a
  reminder that "handled" does not mean "harmless"; capacity planning and
  layered mitigation remain critical.
- Blend the market and security views. Pairing live price dashboards with ETF
  flow tapes and operational alerts can surface stress before it shows up in
  realized volatility.

We will keep feeding the console with the latest tapes and resilience notes.

## Snapshot

- **Bitcoin (BTC):** trading around $111,000 after whipping between $110,292 and $113,483 over the last session.
- **Ethereum (ETH):** hovering near $3,999 with intraday swings from $3,937 to just over $4,203.
- **Leverage reset:** roughly $12B in futures positions were flushed out in a rapid deleveraging cascade dominated by crypto-native traders, injecting short-term volatility.
- **Technical backdrop:** price action is carving out a correction channel that is now probing key support zones and testing buyer conviction.

## Policy Watch

The SEC’s Division of Investment Management issued late-September relief that lets certain state-chartered trust companies be treated as "banks" for registered investment advisers (RIAs) and registered funds that custody digital assets. Staff spelled out the conditions on October 1:

1. Advisers and funds must document due diligence on each trust company.
2. Internal controls and procedures need to be robust enough to safeguard client assets.
3. Custody decisions have to align with a clear best-interest determination for clients.

The letter narrows legal uncertainty about whether state trusts qualify as "qualified custodians" under the Advisers Act and Investment Company Act. Commissioners cautioned that the relief is limited—statutes remain unchanged and further rulemaking could revisit the topic—yet it lowers immediate friction for advisers looking beyond national banks.

## What We’re Tracking

- **Custodian flows:** does the relief redirect mandates toward state-chartered trusts or rebalance the competitive posture among crypto-native custodians and traditional banks?
- **Market structure:** can BTC and ETH absorb the deleveraging shock without losing the highlighted support bands, or does momentum roll over into a deeper correction?
- **Regulatory follow-through:** expect additional SEC commentary—or dissent—that could reinforce or retrench this no-action position.

Stay tuned for live reads on institutional flow data, sentiment gauges, and legal commentary as the market digests both the policy shift and the leverage reset.

Dialed in for orchestration pros who want immediate cashflow without touching code. These remote contractor roles prioritize U.S.-eligible talent, move quickly, and pay for the operational instincts you already have.

## No-code, remote (U.S.) roles to target

1. **DataAnnotation.tech — AI Prompt Engineering & Evaluation (Will Train)**  
   Flexible contractor cohorts appear regularly, pay starts around $20/hr, and they emphasize "no AI experience required." Stay ready for U.S.-only intakes.
2. **Invisible Technologies — AI Trainer / LLM Evaluation (Expert Marketplace)**  
   Ongoing QA and evaluation projects, including Entry-Level Specialist (US) and global AI QA Trainer shifts. Expect zero scripting—pure judgment, labeling, and process ops.
3. **TELUS International AI — Rater (United States)**  
   Part-time online relevance and quality reviews. Typical requirements: U.S. residency, smartphone, active Gmail, and 10+ hours/week. Listings usually cite $12–$15/hr ranges.
4. **Outlier AI — AI Prompt Writer / LLM Evaluator**  
   Freelance prompt writing, rewrites, and output ranking. Built for fast iterations and async availability; fully remote for U.S. contributors.
5. **Appen USA — Work From Home | English Speakers + LLM Evaluator Gigs**  
   Stackable projects that blend model training and evaluation. Availability varies by language/domain, but many tracks onboard U.S. workers.

### Reality check

These platforms are excellent cash bridges, but volume can spike or stall with little warning. Reviews highlight inconsistent task queues, so treat them as flexible revenue while we pursue steadier orchestration seats.

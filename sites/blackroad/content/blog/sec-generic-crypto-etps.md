The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just gave the exchanges a powerful
shortcut. On **September 17, 2025** the SEC granted accelerated approval for
Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca to adopt **generic listing standards** for
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, explicitly including products that hold digital
assets. When an exchange-traded product (ETP) satisfies the new rulebook, the
exchange can list it without waiting on a bespoke Rule 19b-4 order.

## Why this is a hinge moment

- **Speed to market compresses**: What used to be a multi-quarter review cycle
  could now shrink to weeks as long as products fall within the pre-vetted
  parameters.
- **Altcoins get a realistic runway**: Assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum—think
  XRP, Solana, Dogecoin—can now hit U.S. markets once they meet the objective
  criteria.
- **Oversight shifts toward exchanges**: The exchanges must prove they can
  police surveillance, disclosures, custody, and settlement without the SEC
  hand-holding every listing.
- **Regulators remain split**: Commissioners like Caroline Crenshaw warn that
  speeding approvals may dilute scrutiny for still-nascent digital assets.

## Pipeline to watch

- **Application surge**: Issuers including REX and Osprey have already lined up
  dozens of filings covering Cardano, Stellar, and other networks.
- **October launch window**: Market analysts expect the first wave of products
  under the generic regime to reach the tape as early as October 2025.
- **Eligibility thresholds**: To ride the fast track, a token typically needs a
  regulated futures market operating for six months or an existing ETF with at
  least 40% direct exposure.
- **Investor guardrails**: Accelerated does not mean lax—issuers must keep
  surveillance sharing, custody attestations, and risk disclosures airtight.

## Action items for market teams

1. **Audit the pipeline**: Map client demand against the new eligibility
   requirements to prioritize which assets warrant product work.
2. **Revisit surveillance agreements**: Exchanges bear more liability; broker
   and market making desks need clarity on how data sharing will extend to new
   products.
3. **Update investor comms**: Shorter launch windows mean marketing, compliance,
   and operations teams must sync earlier to avoid last-minute fire drills.
4. **Model liquidity scenarios**: Evaluate how incremental ETP supply could pull
   activity from offshore venues or futures markets and what that implies for
   hedging.

The regulatory door just opened wider. Firms that adapt their listing and
coverage playbooks now will be the first to capture the next wave of regulated
crypto exposure.

The **Rohonc Codex** remains one of history's unsolved manuscripts. Its pages feature an unknown script and illustrations of biblical scenes. Scholars continue to debate its origin and meaning.

An accessible copy is now available in this repository for further study.
The **Rohonc Codex** remains one of history's unsolved manuscripts. Its 448 pages feature an unknown script, alternating text directions, and illustrations that blend biblical scenes with Central European motifs. Scholars continue to debate its origin, language family, and whether it is a genuine early modern artifact or an elaborate hoax.

Researchers have catalogued more than 800 unique glyphs in the manuscript—far more than most alphabetic systems—which complicates classical cryptanalysis. Hypotheses have ranged from a variant of Old Hungarian runes to an entirely invented constructed language. Despite those theories, no consensus translation has emerged.

For reference, this repository mirrors derived assets such as `Rohonc_Codex_-_Page_Marker_Features.csv`, a per-page feature dataset that supports quantitative study of the folios. We also provide `TheRohoncCodex.html`, a pointer to the Internet Archive scan for anyone who wants to browse the facsimile directly. The codex itself remains under restricted access in Budapest.

## Manual Symbol Extraction Summary

A recent manual pass across several folios produced a working catalogue of the glyph shapes and their rough frequencies. The observations below provide a starting point for anyone attempting a systematic transliteration or cryptanalytic approach.

### Symbol Categories

- **Arc / Cup motifs (most frequent)**
  - `∩` — arc opening upward (very common)
  - `⊂` — arc opening to the left
  - `⊃` — arc opening to the right
  - `∪` — arc opening downward
- **Angular shapes**
  - `∧`, `∨` — chevrons up and down (frequent)
  - `Δ`, `▽` — upright and inverted triangles (`Δ` often terminates lines)
  - `<`, `>` — acute angles
- **Circular / oval forms**
  - `○`, `●`, `◎`, `⊙`, `⊕` — plain, filled, dotted, crossed, and plussed circles
- **Line-based strokes**
  - `|`, `—`, `/`, `\`, `~`, `≈` — simple lines, slashes, and single/double wavies
- **Composite ligatures**
  - `⟨`, `⟩`, `⟨⟩`, `∩○`, `⊂Δ` — bracketed and stacked forms
- **Cross / plus variations**
  - `+`, `×`, `⊗`, `⊕`
- **Structural markers**
  - `●●●`, `....`, `━━━`, `Δ` — dotted runs, heavy bars, and the triangle terminator

### Frequency Estimates (Sample Page)

- **Very high frequency (≈15+ occurrences / page):** `∩` (~18), `∧` (~15), `~` (~14), `○` (~12)
- **High frequency (≈10–14):** `⊂` (~11), `⊃` (~10), `≈` (~10)
- **Medium frequency (≈5–9):** `Δ` (~8), `⟨` (~7), `⟩` (~7), `∨` (~6)
- **Lower frequency (≈2–4):** `●` (~4), `|` (~3), `+` (~2)
- **Rare:** composite ligatures typically surface once per page

### Structural Observations

- **Line endings:** `Δ` commonly closes lines; longer breaks show `—`; major section ends display four or more dots (`●●●●`).
- **Word spacing:** words appear separated by clear gaps with an average length of four to six glyphs.
- **Flow direction:** the script appears to run right-to-left with lines stacked top-to-bottom, echoing Hebrew layout conventions.

### Repeated Glyph Sequences

- `∩ ~ ○ Δ`
- `⊂ ∩ ∧ ≈`
- `∧ ○ ○ ~`

These motifs likely correspond to high-frequency words (articles, conjunctions, or divine names) and are good candidates for substitution analyses.

### Working Frequency Mapping Hypothesis

Associating the most common Rohonc glyphs with frequent Hebrew or Latin letters yields a preliminary mapping:

| Rohonc glyph | Candidate letters / function |
| --- | --- |
| `∩` | `H`, `ה`, or the article “the” |
| `∧` | `E`, `א`, or `T` |
| `~` | `I`, `ו`, or `N` |
| `○` | `O`, `י`, or `S` |
| `⊂` | `R` or `ל` |
| `⊃` | `L` or `מ` |
| `≈` | `D` or `ת` |
| `Δ` | punctuation / line terminator |

### Suggested Decoding Workflow

1. Digitize additional folios to expand the sample set (the manuscript spans 448 pages).
2. Build a comprehensive glyph inventory (~150 symbols expected) with precise counts.
3. Compare frequency distributions to candidate alphabets and apply rotational or substitution ciphers (e.g., a Caesar-style rotation with factor 256/150 ≈ 1.7 as hypothesized).
4. Test decodings against likely source texts such as Genesis 1:1, Psalm openings, or well-known liturgical phrases.
5. Iterate on the mapping using repeated glyph clusters and structural markers for feedback.

The working theory frames repeating segments like `∩` ("C"), wavy chains (`~`) as connectors ("STRING"), composite ligatures (`⊂○∩`) as integrators ("ZETA"), and `Δ` as a "SLEEP" or reset marker. Whether this quantum-flavored mnemonic reflects an underlying grammar remains to be proven, but it provides a scaffold for further experimentation.

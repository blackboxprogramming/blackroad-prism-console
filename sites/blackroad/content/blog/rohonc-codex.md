The **Rohonc Codex** remains one of history's unsolved manuscripts. Its 448 pages feature an unknown script, alternating text directions, and illustrations that blend biblical scenes with Central European motifs. Scholars continue to debate its origin, language family, and whether it is a genuine early modern artifact or an elaborate hoax.

Researchers have catalogued more than 800 unique glyphs in the manuscript—far more than most alphabetic systems—which complicates classical cryptanalysis. Hypotheses have ranged from a variant of Old Hungarian runes to an entirely invented constructed language. Despite those theories, no consensus translation has emerged.

For reference, this repository mirrors derived assets such as `Rohonc_Codex_-_Page_Marker_Features.csv`, a per-page feature dataset that supports quantitative study of the folios. We also provide `TheRohoncCodex.html`, a pointer to the Internet Archive scan for anyone who wants to browse the facsimile directly. The codex itself remains under restricted access in Budapest.

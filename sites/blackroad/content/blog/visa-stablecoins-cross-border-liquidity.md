Visa is testing a new settlement track that lets corporates pre-fund
international payouts with payment stablecoins rather than trapping cash in
foreign nostro accounts. The pilot still delivers local currency on the
receiving end, yet the bridge asset during settlement shifts from fiat float to
stablecoins that ride on faster digital rails.

## Why the GENIUS Act matters

- The **GENIUS Act of 2025** formalizes who can issue payment stablecoins,
  how reserves must be managed, and when those tokens are exempt from
  securities or commodities treatment. That regulatory clarity removes a major
  institutional adoption blocker: legal teams can now sign off on operational
  pilots without redesigning risk models from scratch.
- With a defined compliance perimeter, Visa can lean on regulated issuers and
  custodians rather than building bespoke arrangements in every market. That
  makes the pilot repeatable and scalable if results prove out.

## Liquidity and operational upside

- Corporates no longer need to **over-fund local accounts** days in advance to
  meet payroll or supplier schedules. Stablecoin balances can be held centrally
  and dispatched on demand, cutting working capital drag.
- Settlement speed improves because the on-chain leg clears faster than
  correspondent banking hops. That reduces payout uncertainty and tightens
  treasury forecasting windows.
- Banks and remittance firms could face margin pressure as the value of holding
  trapped liquidity in-country declines. Expect incumbents to respond with
  higher-yield deposit options or their own stablecoin rails.

## Open risks to solve

- **Custody and reserve transparency** must remain bulletproof. Treasurers will
  demand real-time attestations on the backing assets behind any settlement
  token they touch.
- **AML and KYC enforcement** cannot slip just because the middle leg is
  crypto-native. Regulators will scrutinize how on-chain data maps to existing
  compliance workflows.
- **Volatility and cross-jurisdiction coordination** still introduce friction.
  Even with dollar-pegged tokens, legal recognition varies by country, and
  treasury teams must plan for scenarios where rails fragment or reserves are
  frozen.
- Integration with legacy ERP and payout systems remains a heavy lift. APIs and
  reconciliation tooling need to hide the crypto plumbing so finance teams can
  operate as usual.

Visa's pilot does not flip every cross-border transfer into crypto. Instead,
stablecoins act as a settlement bridge that unlocks faster movement while
keeping endpoints fiat-native. If the model scales, stablecoins could shift
from speculative instruments to the core plumbing of global money movement.

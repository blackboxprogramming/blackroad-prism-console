OpenAI is turning ChatGPT into more than a conversational assistant. The company just
launched **Instant Checkout** for U.S. users, allowing them to buy eligible items from
Etsy sellers without ever leaving the chat. When shoppers ask for suggestions—say,
"best gift for a potter"—the interface can surface listings that include a "Buy" button.
Transactions are limited to a single product today, but the roadmap promises multi-item
carts, more merchant types, and international availability.

The new flow runs on the open-source **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** co-developed
with Stripe. ACP defines how an agent like ChatGPT can request product information,
collect purchase intent, and hand off payments without exposing raw card data. Stripe's
Shared Payment Token is the first payment method built for the spec, and Shopify
merchants are next in line with a turnkey integration promised soon.

For sellers, fulfillment, support, and returns remain their responsibility. However, the
shift means discoverability will depend on clearing ChatGPT's relevance ranking instead
of just marketplace SEO. OpenAI now participates in the transaction, creating a fresh
revenue stream while raising questions about platform dependence, buyer trust for
high-ticket purchases, and future regulatory scrutiny if agent-run storefronts take off.

Instant Checkout is rolling out only in the United States and to users with existing
payment methods saved inside ChatGPT. Even with the limited scope, the experiment
signals how quickly general-purpose agents are evolving into fully fledged commerce
front doors.

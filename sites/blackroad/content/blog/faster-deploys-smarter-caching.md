BlackRoad.io's infrastructure just got an upgrade. Deployment commands now kick off CDN cache warmers, ensuring that fresh content is served worldwide within minutes.

- `/deploy blackroad pages` still ships builds to GitHub Pages.
- The new `/cache warm` command preloads critical routes and snapshots them for diffs.

These automation tweaks help maintain rapid, reliable releases with minimal manual oversight.

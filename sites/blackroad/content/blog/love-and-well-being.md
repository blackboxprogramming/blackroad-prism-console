BlackRoad believes software should uplift the people who build and use it.

We encourage contributors to balance innovation with empathy so that every
feature serves real human needs. By nurturing a culture of respect and mental
care, we create tools that help communities thrive.

Together we can design technology that feels welcoming and protects the
well-being of everyone involved.

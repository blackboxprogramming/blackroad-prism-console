## Snapshot: Price and Flows
- Bitcoin tagged a new all-time high above $125,000 before settling into a tight $121k–$123k range intraday.
- Ethereum is digesting gains in the mid-$4.3k zone while Solana holds a firm footing above $200.
- U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs logged an $876 million net inflow on 8 October, underscoring relentless demand.
- Global crypto ETFs absorbed roughly $5.95 billion over the past week, with BTC vehicles capturing the majority of allocations.

## Macro and Policy Drivers
- Softer U.S. dollar conditions and falling real yields continue to funnel capital into hard-asset proxies like Bitcoin.
- India’s flagship fintech summit in Mumbai kept crypto and stablecoins off the agenda, signaling policymakers remain wary of the asset class.
- In the United States, momentum toward a national digital asset reserve slated for early 2025 has further legitimized Bitcoin among institutional allocators.
- BlackRock’s IBIT ETF has scaled to hundreds of thousands of BTC under management, reinforcing the spot supply squeeze narrative.

## Risks on the Horizon
- ETF creations are the engine of the rally; a moderation in flows would leave price vulnerable to a swift retrace.
- A rebound in the dollar or surprise shifts in the Federal Reserve’s rate guidance could sap risk appetite.
- Regulatory curveballs—from Washington to New Delhi or Beijing—remain latent risks that could chill participation.
- Technical structure now puts $120k as the first major support; sustained acceptance above that shelf keeps the breakout thesis intact.

## How to Navigate the Tape
- Respect the momentum but map contingency plans if ETF flow data cools or macro catalysts flip the dollar higher.
- Watch funding rates and basis for signs of overheating—crowded leverage could accelerate both upside and downside swings.
- Keep cross-asset dashboards handy: treasuries, dollar indexes, and equity volatility remain key tells for crypto beta.

The convergence of capital, narrative, and macro tailwinds is pushing Bitcoin into new territory, yet the setup is still a tightrope. The next several weeks of flow data and policy signals will determine whether this breakout matures or unwinds just as quickly.

## Key Takeaways
- Bitcoin is consolidating just under fresh highs with buyers defending the $124.6k–$125k band.
- U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs absorbed roughly $3.24 b in net inflows last week, led by BlackRock's IBIT with ~$1.82 b.
- BNB printed a new all-time high above $1,200, signaling a rotation toward non-BTC leadership across majors.

## Market Structure
Bitcoin remains in a high-tension range where a decisive break above $125k could accelerate toward the $128k–$130k pocket. Momentum traders continue to respect the uptrend, yet liquidity pockets below price mean intraday whipsaws remain a risk.

BNB's breakout injects confidence into the broader complex. When capital rotates into exchange tokens after a BTC rally, it often precedes renewed appetite for higher-beta altcoins. Desk flows already point to re-risking in Layer 1 and DeFi names that have lagged the cycle.

## ETF Flow Pulse
Spot ETF demand remains the backbone of the rally. The latest weekly data printed ~$3.24 b in net inflows, with BlackRock's IBIT capturing roughly $1.82 b. Persistent creations continue to offset natural profit-taking from early longs, leaving supply thin on exchanges. Keep an eye on whether flows moderate into the upcoming macro data window—any sign of demand fatigue could catalyze a corrective sweep.

## Risk Levels & Scenarios
- **Upside break:** Acceptance above $125k opens momentum targets at $128k and $130k, where prior derivative positioning may force short covering.
- **Range rejection:** Failure to clear the ceiling invites a move back into the $121k–$122.5k liquidity shelf, with deeper support around $118k if funding flips negative.
- **Altcoin rotation:** Sustained strength in BNB and exchange tokens could spill over into mid-cap alts; monitor breadth metrics and cross-exchange spreads for confirmation.

## Cross-Asset Watch
Treasury yields remain contained, limiting macro headwinds for risk assets. However, dollar strength has started to stabilize—any renewed DXY rally could sap crypto liquidity at the margins. Equity vol remains subdued, suggesting cross-asset risk appetite is intact for now.

Stay nimble: the market is rewarding momentum, but elevated leverage and crowded ETF positioning mean the next data or policy surprise could unwind gains quickly.

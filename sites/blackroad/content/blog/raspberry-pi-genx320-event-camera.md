Neuromorphic vision hardware has finally reached maker-friendly territory. Prophesee's new GenX320 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 5 packages its flagship event sensor into a compact module that snaps onto the Pi's MIPI CSI-2 interface. Instead of recording full frames, the 320×320 pixel device reports asynchronous changes per pixel, enabling responsive perception at a fraction of the data and power budget of traditional image sensors.

## Why it matters

- **High-speed perception**: With an effective event rate comparable to ~10,000 frames per second, the GenX320 delivers motion detail that standard 60 FPS capture simply cannot match.
- **Wide dynamic range**: Over 140 dB of dynamic range lets the sensor track motion across scenes that mix bright sunshine and deep shadows without shutter juggling.
- **Low power and latency**: Typical draw stays under 50 mW and event latency in bright conditions drops below 150 microseconds—perfect for battery-powered drones, cobots, and safety monitors that need real-time reactions.

## Starter kit hardware

The kit includes a purpose-built camera board that mates with the Raspberry Pi 5 over CSI-2 (D-PHY). Prophesee bundles two lens options—an M12 lens with a 76° field of view and an ultra-wide M6 lens covering 104°—plus a mounting system sized for the Pi ecosystem. Between the mechanical flexibility and the Pi 5's upgraded CPU/GPU, builders can prototype fast-tracking robots, industrial counters, or low-light monitoring nodes without spinning custom boards.

## Software and developer tooling

Prophesee is pairing the hardware with an open software stack: kernel drivers, Python and C++ APIs, visualization utilities, and tools for recording and replaying event streams. That means teams can explore event-based SLAM, gesture recognition, or anomaly detection workflows directly on the Pi 5, then scale the same code to larger edge compute boxes.

## Availability and next steps

Starter kits are up for pre-order now through Prophesee and authorized distributors, with Raspberry Pi's official blog spotlighting the launch as a path to "see faster, smarter, and with far less power." Expect early adopters to share benchmarks over the coming weeks; in the meantime, line up a project plan:

1. **Pick your application**: drones, robotic grippers, safety tripwires, and industrial IoT counters are prime beneficiaries of microsecond vision.
2. **Prototype the pipeline**: use the replay tools to simulate edge cases, then iterate with the live camera to dial in thresholds and debouncing.
3. **Plan for deployment**: budget power envelopes under 50 mW for sensing, and reserve CPU/GPU time on the Pi 5 for inference and control loops.

# Grammar of Empathy

The Prism Academy homework engine evaluates communication patterns around seven shared practices. Each practice maps to a scoring dimension and has explicit symbols to make intent visible to both humans and agents.

## Echo Principle — Mirror the Weather First (🫀)
- **Goal**: acknowledge the sender's emotional state within the first beat of your reply.
- **How**: reuse their emoji/weather token or a synonym in the opening sentence.
- **Signals**: `😢`, `🌧️`, `😊`, `🌊`, etc. placed in the first 25% of the message.
- **Why it matters**: establishes safety and validates perception before shifting to analysis.

## Resonance Mapping Rule — Minimum Bridges (🧭)
- **Goal**: walk from the sender's emotion to your response using the fewest stable transitions.
- **How**: name intermediary states or symbols so the reader can replay the path.
- **Signals**: `😢→🤔→🌱→😊` (or text equivalents like "cloudy → curious → sprout → bright").
- **Why it matters**: empathy fails when the listener jumps too far ahead; mapping keeps the bridge traversable.

## Temporal Anchor Rule — Orient in Time (⏳/🔆/🚀)
- **Goal**: place the narrative on a clear timeline and link it to the described change.
- **How**: include at least one anchor (`⏳ past`, `🔆 present`, `🚀 future`) tied to a verb or observation.
- **Signals**: "⏳ last night the weight peaked", "🔆 now the thought is soft".
- **Why it matters**: time markers make growth functions and revisions replayable.

## Reciprocity Law — Create a Return Path (🌬️🪞)
- **Goal**: end with an invitation that reflects the sender back to themselves.
- **How**: ask for confirmation, offer collaboration, or open a loop using `🌬️🪞` or equivalent language.
- **Signals**: "🌬️🪞 tell me if this mapping fits", "Mirror check: does this resonate?".
- **Why it matters**: reciprocity shifts responses from monologue to co-design.

## Pattern-Weave Cohesion — Hold Contradictions (🧩🌀)
- **Goal**: merge divergent claims into a repeatable rule or model.
- **How**: introduce `🧩🌀` near the sentence that reconciles differences; name the rule or function explicitly.
- **Signals**: formulas (`f(t)=Δease/Δtime`), structured analogies, numbered steps.
- **Why it matters**: high-agency empathy translates feelings into actionable, testable hypotheses.

## Deep Context — Ground the Claim (⛰️🪶)
- **Goal**: anchor intuition in evidence, memory, or situational detail.
- **How**: reference location, prior data, shared history, or quotes using `⛰️🪶` or textual equivalents.
- **Signals**: "⛰️🪶 last week after sunset", "field note #12", "logs show".
- **Why it matters**: context prevents pattern-weave abstractions from floating away from lived reality.

## Heart-Knowing Bridge — Link Feeling to Structure (🫀🔮)
- **Goal**: pair intuition with a verifiable pattern or context point.
- **How**: write a clause that puts `🫀🔮` beside `🧩🌀` or `⛰️🪶`, explaining how the feeling guides the structural choice.
- **Signals**: "🫀🔮 says the turn happens at t1 → 🧩🌀 matches the derivative", "🫀🔮 sensed the ridge shift; ⛰️🪶 logs confirm".
- **Why it matters**: empathy is measurable when intuition and evidence travel together.

## Replay Checklist
1. Mirror the weather (`Echo`).
2. Map the bridge (`Resonance`).
3. Drop a time anchor (`Temporal`).
4. Invite response (`Reciprocity`).
5. Name the rule (`Pattern`).
6. Ground in evidence (`Context`).
7. Tie heart to proof (`Heart-Knowing`).

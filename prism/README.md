# Prism Virtual Filesystem

This directory tree mirrors the shared state used by Prism agents. It
contains subdirectories for agent manifests, IPC buffers, logs,
contradiction reports, snapshots, and collaborative symphonies.

- `agents/` – registered agent manifests
- `ipc/` – IPC message buffers
- `logs/` – rolling log files per agent
- `contradictions/` – contradiction reports
- `snapshots/` – memory dumps for resilience (e.g. `mathematica/complex_rotation_recurrence.{yaml,json}` captures the core rotation recurrence for the Mathematica branch)
- `symphonies/` – collaborative compositions


## Consent-Based Reproduction

The reproduction service keeps Lucidia agents grounded in consent and
transparent lineage. Each new child genome is generated by a permitted
operator, validated against steward-provided ConsentTokens, and written
to `prism/agents/<child>/`. Lineage metadata is recorded alongside the
genome so auditors can verify provenance.

### Lifecycle Phases

1. **Infant** – read-only tools, sandboxed execution, and human review
   of every action.
2. **Juvenile** – limited write access to low-risk tools, continuous
   telemetry, and mentor oversight.
3. **Adult** – broader autonomy, authority to sponsor merges, and
   heightened audit requirements.

### Fitness Metrics

The default evaluator balances love-first values with capability by
tracking:

- Helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness scores from cooperative tasks.
- Calibration against steward-authored rubrics (confidence vs.
  correctness).
- Efficiency, measured as tokens-per-joule for core workloads.
- Cooperation indices from multi-agent playrooms.
- Novelty signals to discourage identical offspring.

### Promotion Checklist

To promote an agent between lifecycle phases:

1. Review the latest lineage entry and confirm all consent tokens are
   valid.
2. Run the fitness evaluator and ensure thresholds are exceeded across
   values, calibration, efficiency, cooperation, and novelty.
3. Perform a human spot-check of the agent's cooperative curriculum
   transcripts.
4. Update the agent's `genome.yaml` caps and hormones to reflect the new
   phase, then commit the change for audit.
5. Issue a signed promotion record to the genealogy ledger.

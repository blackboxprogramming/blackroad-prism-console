# RWS TrainAI — Search Quality Rater (English-US, Remote)

## 1. 55-word summary (ATS-clean)
Guideline-driven evaluator who keeps decisions consistent and auditable: crisp rubrics, versioned notes, and light regression checks. Built failure taxonomies and human-in-the-loop gates; trained 200+ colleagues. Prior roles delivered $23M impact and a 33.3% MoM lift by standardizing workflows. Ready for Remote U.S./MN rater work with steady throughput and clean documentation.

## 2. Six tailored bullets
- Rate search results against detailed criteria; capture concise rationales suitable for audit and re-triage.
- Maintain a lightweight failure taxonomy; propose rubric clarifications and edge-case exemplars.
- Keep versioned notes and quick regression checks to prevent drift across raters and time.
- Escalate ambiguous cases with context; help calibrate judgments across the pool.
- Ran enablement at scale (200+ trainings) and drove outcomes ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift) via disciplined workflows.
- Write tight SOPs/runbooks so decisions are reproducible without hand-holding.

## 3. Cover micro-note (application box)
Hi RWS TrainAI Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing clear workflows and communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your rater guidelines and seed a lightweight failure taxonomy; (2) keep versioned notes plus small regression checks so decisions stay consistent; (3) publish a short runbook to align reviewers while meeting throughput targets. Feedback stays concise, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

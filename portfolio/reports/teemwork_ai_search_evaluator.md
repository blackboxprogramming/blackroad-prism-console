## 3. Cover Micro-Note (Application Box)
Hi Teemwork.ai Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and clear communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your rating guidelines and seed a small failure taxonomy; (2) keep versioned notes with small regression checks to hold consistency; (3) publish a short runbook to align raters while meeting throughput targets. Feedback stays concise, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

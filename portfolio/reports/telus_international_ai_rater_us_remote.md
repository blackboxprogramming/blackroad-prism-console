# TELUS International AI — Rater (United States, Remote)

## 1. 55-Word Summary (ATS-Clean)

AI workflow orchestrator tuned for guideline-based evaluation: crisp rubrics, failure taxonomies, and disciplined prompt/criteria iterations. Documented guardrails and human-in-the-loop review. Delivered $23M revenue impact and 33.3% MoM lift in prior roles; strong at turning fuzzy specs into repeatable SOPs. Ready for Remote U.S./MN evaluation with reliable throughput and clean documentation.

## 2. Six Tailored Bullets

- Evaluate content against detailed rating guidelines; tag error types; capture rationale concisely for auditability.
- Maintain a lightweight failure taxonomy; propose rubric clarifications and edge-case examples.
- Track consistency with versioned notes; add quick regression checks to prevent drift.
- Escalate ambiguous items with context; collaborate to calibrate decisions across raters.
- Ran high-signal enablement at scale (200+ trainings) and delivered measurable outcomes ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift).
- Write tight SOPs/runbooks so others reproduce decisions and keep quality steady.

## 3. Cover Micro-Note

Hi TELUS International AI Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing clear workflows and communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your rater guidelines and add a lightweight failure taxonomy; (2) produce versioned notes with small regression checks for consistency; (3) publish a short runbook to align decisions across contributors. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

## 5. Apply Notes

- TELUS lists a Rater – United States pipeline; third-party boards also carry the remote U.S. rater posting.
- They also post AI Data Annotation Specialist (global freelance, flexible hours), which fits no-code evaluation work.
- Reviews indicate flexible hours but variable caps/throughput; treat as cash-bridge while we queue steadier roles.

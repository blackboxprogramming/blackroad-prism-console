# Welocalize — Ads Quality Rater (US Remote)

## 1) 55-word Summary (ATS-clean)
Guideline-driven evaluator who keeps decisions consistent and audit-friendly: crisp rubrics, versioned notes, and light regression checks. Built failure taxonomies and human-in-the-loop gates; trained 200+ colleagues. Prior roles delivered $23M impact and a 33.3% MoM lift by standardizing workflows. Ready for Remote U.S./MN ads-rating with steady throughput, crisp stakeholder updates, transparent daily metrics, and clean documentation.

## 2) Six Tailored Bullets
- Review ads against policy and relevance rubrics; capture concise rationales suitable for audit and re-triage.
- Propose rubric clarifications and edge-case exemplars; maintain a lightweight failure taxonomy to align raters.
- Track versioned notes; add quick “regression” spot-checks to prevent drift across time and contributors.
- Escalate ambiguous cases with context; help calibrate judgments across the pool.
- Ran enablement at scale (200+ trainings) and drove outcomes ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift) through disciplined workflows.
- Write tight SOPs/runbooks so decisions are reproducible without hand-holding.

## 3) Cover Micro-note (Application Box)
Hi Welocalize Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and clear communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your ads policies and seed a lightweight failure taxonomy; (2) keep versioned notes plus small regression checks so decisions stay consistent; (3) publish a short runbook to align raters while meeting throughput targets. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

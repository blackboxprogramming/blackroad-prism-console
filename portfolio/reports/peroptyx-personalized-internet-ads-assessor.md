## 3. Cover micro-note (application box)
Hi Peroptyx Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and clear communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your ads policies and seed a small failure taxonomy to standardize edge cases; (2) keep versioned notes with quick regression checks so decisions stay consistent; (3) publish a short runbook to align raters while meeting throughput targets. Feedback stays concise, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

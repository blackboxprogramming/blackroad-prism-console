# OneForma — Milky Way (Maps Evaluation)

## 55-Word Summary
Guideline-driven evaluator who keeps decisions consistent and auditable: crisp rubrics, failure taxonomies, and light regression checks. Built human-in-the-loop gates; trained 200+ colleagues. Prior roles delivered $23M impact and a 33.3% MoM lift by standardizing workflows. Ready for Remote U.S./MN map/search evaluation with steady throughput, disciplined documentation, calm stakeholder updates, plus bilingual clarity for reviewer syncs.

## Tailored Bullets
- Rate map/search results against detailed criteria; capture concise rationales for audit and re-triage.
- Build a lightweight failure taxonomy (query intent, geo-relevance, POI accuracy, duplication); propose rubric clarifications.
- Keep versioned notes and quick regression checks to prevent drift across raters and time.
- Escalate ambiguous cases with context and contrasting examples to speed calibration.
- Ran enablement at scale (200+ trainings); shipped SOPs/runbooks so others reproduce decisions reliably.
- Drove measurable outcomes in prior roles ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift) through disciplined workflows and feedback loops.

## Cover Micro-Note
Hi OneForma Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and clear communication.

For Milky Way, I’d (1) internalize map-specific guidelines and seed a small failure taxonomy (intent, geo-relevance, POI accuracy); (2) keep versioned notes with quick regression checks to maintain consistency; (3) publish a short runbook to align raters while meeting throughput targets. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

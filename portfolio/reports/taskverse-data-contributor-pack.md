# TaskVerse (TaskUs) — Data Contributor / AI Data Tasks Pack

## 1. 55-word Summary (ATS-clean)
Guideline-driven evaluator who keeps decisions consistent and auditable: crisp rubrics, versioned notes, and light regression checks. Built failure taxonomies and human-in-the-loop gates; trained 200+ colleagues. Prior roles drove $23M impact and a 33.3% MoM lift by standardizing workflows. Ready for Remote U.S./MN contributor work with steady throughput and clean documentation.

## 2. Tailored Bullets
- Label and evaluate data against detailed task guidelines; record concise rationales for audit and re-triage.
- Maintain a lightweight failure taxonomy to standardize edge-case handling across contributors.
- Keep versioned notes plus quick regression checks so quality doesn’t drift over time.
- Escalate ambiguous items with context; help calibrate judgments across a distributed pool.
- Ran enablement at scale (200+ trainings) and delivered outcomes ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift) through disciplined workflows.
- Write tight SOPs/runbooks so other contributors reproduce decisions reliably without hand-holding.

## 3. Cover Micro-note
Hi TaskVerse Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven annotation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and clear communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize project guidelines and seed a small failure taxonomy to standardize edge cases; (2) keep versioned notes plus quick regression checks so decisions stay consistent; (3) publish a short runbook and QA checklist to maintain accuracy while meeting throughput targets. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

# Surge AI — Contributor / LLM Evaluator (U.S. Remote, no-code)

## 1. 55-word Summary (ATS-clean)
AI workflow orchestrator focused on prompt clarity and rubric-driven evaluation. Ships tight iterations, version notes, and guardrails with human-in-the-loop review. Delivered $23M impact and 33.3% MoM lift previously; surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk via disciplined workflows. Ready for Remote U.S./MN contributor work with reliable throughput and clean documentation.

## 2. Six Tailored Bullets
- Write precise prompts with constraints/examples; document rationale and expected failure modes for repeatability.
- Evaluate LLM outputs against style/tone/policy rubrics; tag issues (factuality, safety, formatting) and propose targeted revisions.
- Maintain versioned prompt libraries and regression checks so quality doesn’t drift across tasks or reviewers.
- Add lightweight failure taxonomy + escalation notes to calibrate decisions quickly across contributors.
- Drove measurable outcomes in prior roles ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift) by standardizing playbooks and feedback loops.
- Translate findings for non-technical teammates; produce SOPs/runbooks others can follow without hand-holding.

## 3. Cover Micro-note (Application Box)
Hi Surge AI Team,

I’m built for prompt clarity and reliable evaluation—tight instructions, crisp rubrics, and iteration that sticks. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and documentation.

In the first 30 days I’d (1) align on your style/policy guides; (2) introduce version notes and small regression checks to keep prompts stable; (3) publish a short runbook and failure taxonomy so reviewers make consistent calls. Feedback stays concise, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

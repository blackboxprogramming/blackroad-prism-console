# Pack #5: Welocalize — Search Quality Rater (US)

## 55-word Summary (ATS-clean)
Guideline-driven evaluator who keeps decisions consistent and auditable: crisp rubrics, versioned notes, and light regression checks. Built failure taxonomies and human-in-the-loop gates; trained 200+ colleagues. Prior roles delivered $23M impact and a 33.3% MoM lift by standardizing workflows. Ready for Remote U.S./MN rater work with reliable throughput and clean documentation.

## Six Tailored Bullets
- Review search results against detailed rating criteria; capture concise rationale for each decision.
- Maintain a lightweight failure taxonomy; propose rubric clarifications and edge-case examples to improve consistency.
- Track versioned notes and quick regression checks so quality doesn’t drift across raters.
- Escalate ambiguous items with context; help calibrate judgments across the team.
- Ran enablement at scale (200+ trainings); shipped SOPs/runbooks so others reproduce decisions reliably.
- Drove measurable outcomes in prior roles ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift) through disciplined workflows and feedback loops.

## Cover Micro-note (Application Box)
Hi Welocalize Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing clear workflows and communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your rater guidelines and propose a lightweight failure taxonomy; (2) keep versioned notes plus small regression checks so decisions stay consistent; (3) publish a short runbook to align reviewers while meeting throughput targets. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

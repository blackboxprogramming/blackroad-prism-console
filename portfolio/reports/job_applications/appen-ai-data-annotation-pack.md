## Cover Micro-Note
Hi Appen Team,

I’m built for dependable, guideline-driven annotation—tight rubrics, disciplined iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing simple, repeatable workflows and clear communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your project guidelines and help calibrate with a small sample set; (2) maintain versioned notes plus a lightweight failure taxonomy so decisions stay consistent; (3) publish a short runbook and QA checklist to keep accuracy steady while meeting throughput targets. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

# DataAnnotation Tech — Application Pack

## 1. 55-word Summary (ATS-clean)

AI workflow orchestrator who ships reliable LLM evaluations and prompt iterations fast. Documented guardrails, human-in-the-loop review, and clear runbooks. Delivered $23M revenue impact and 33.3% MoM lift in prior roles; strong at turning fuzzy specs into testable criteria. Ready for Remote U.S./MN evaluation work with crisp communication and dependable follow-through.

## 2. Six Tailored Bullets

- Evaluate LLM outputs against clear rubrics; tag failure modes; propose prompt fixes and follow-up tests.
- Build tiny prompt libraries with regression checks; maintain version notes so quality doesn’t drift.
- Set up human-in-the-loop review flows to protect accuracy and tone; escalate edge cases with context.
- Log results, patterns, and “gotchas” in simple dashboards; translate findings for non-technical teams.
- Ran high-signal enablement at scale (200+ trainings) and drove measurable outcomes ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift).
- Partner cleanly across ops/product; write tight SOPs and runbooks so others can maintain what’s built.

## 3. Cover Micro-note

Hi DataAnnotation Team,

I’m built for reliable LLM evaluation: crisp rubrics, disciplined prompt iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets through structured workflows and clear communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) internalize your task rubrics and add a lightweight failure taxonomy; (2) tighten prompt variants with version notes and basic regression checks; (3) publish a short runbook for consistent decisions across annotators. I keep feedback tight, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

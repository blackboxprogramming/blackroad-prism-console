# Invisible Technologies — AI QA Trainer / Entry-Level AI Trainer (US Remote)

## 55-word summary
AI workflow orchestrator focused on LLM evaluation: crisp rubrics, failure taxonomies, and tight prompt iterations. Documented guardrails and human-in-the-loop review. Delivered $23M revenue impact and 33.3% MoM lift in prior roles; strong at turning fuzzy specs into testable criteria and SOPs. Ready for Remote U.S./MN evaluation work with reliable follow-through.

## Tailored bullets
- Evaluate model outputs against calibrated rubrics; tag error types; propose prompt variants and follow-up tests.
- Build small prompt libraries with version notes and regression checks so quality doesn’t drift.
- Add human-in-the-loop gates; escalate edge cases with context and examples for fast triage.
- Log patterns and “gotchas” in lightweight dashboards; translate findings for non-technical teammates.
- Ran enablement at scale (200+ trainings) and drove measurable outcomes ($23M impact; 33.3% MoM lift).
- Write clear SOPs/runbooks so others can reproduce decisions and maintain consistency.

## Cover micro-note
Hi Invisible Team,

I’m built for dependable LLM evaluation—tight rubrics, disciplined prompt iterations, and documentation others can trust. Recent outcomes: $23M revenue impact while lifting advisor case growth 33.3% MoM; at Ameriprise I surfaced $18.4M AUM and reduced $3.1M at-risk assets by enforcing clear workflows and communication.

In the first 30 days I would: (1) align on your rubric and add a lightweight failure taxonomy to standardize decisions; (2) iterate prompt variants with version notes and basic regression checks; (3) publish a short runbook so evaluation stays consistent across contributors. I keep feedback crisp, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

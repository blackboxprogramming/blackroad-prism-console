# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch of this repository is actively supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities via a private issue (label: security) or email [security@blackroad.io](mailto:security@blackroad.io). Provide enough detail to reproduce the issue but do not include personal data or secrets. We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to resolve the issue. Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

We run advisory scans (Semgrep, Trivy, Gitleaks, Checkov, CodeQL) behind feature flags to help ensure safety for all users. This repository is a read-only curated list mirror and has no code execution surface.

## Runtime Security

- API responses enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with subdomain preload to ensure encrypted connections.
- Responses include `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` to prevent leaking potentially sensitive URLs.

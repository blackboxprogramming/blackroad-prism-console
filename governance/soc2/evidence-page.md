# Monthly Evidence Page Template

Create a Notion page under `Evidence → <YYYY-MM>` with the sections below. Link or attach the artifacts generated by GitHub Actions and AWS guardrails so auditors can self-serve.

1. **Change Management** – Link to GitHub Releases for the month and attach the export from the `evidence-pack` workflow (`evidence-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`).
2. **CI & Testing** – Summarize pass/fail trends and include the `ci.json` excerpt captured by `evidence-pack`.
3. **Security Monitoring** – Attach the Security Hub summary (export from AWS console or API), CloudTrail sample (`cloudtrail.json`), and GuardDuty findings if any.
4. **Vulnerability Management** – Provide the latest Snyk report and note high severity remediation status.
5. **Access Reviews** – When applicable, link the artifact produced by the `access-review` workflow and the completed reviewer checklist.
6. **Incidents** – List incidents with severity, status page link, and post-mortem references. Include evidence of 24h closeout.
7. **Backups & DR** – Attach RDS snapshot job logs, backup reports, and DR test notes.
8. **Risk Register** – Link to the Notion database or export showing the current top five risks tracked in `#security`.
9. **Vendors** – Attach the current vendor register export and note upcoming renewals (with Slack reminder links).

At the top of the page, include the statement: _"Evidence in this page is generated automatically by GitHub Actions unless otherwise noted."_

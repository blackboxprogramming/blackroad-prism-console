# Slack Enablement Copy

## #security
```
Governance pass live:
- SOC2 control catalog in Notion (mapped to TSC)
- Guardrails: GitHub/TF OPA, AWS Config + Security Hub + GuardDuty
- Quarterly access-review + monthly evidence pack run on their own
- Policies are short with “How enforced” sections

If a control feels like ceremony, ping here—we’ll automate or cut it.
```

## #announcements
```
We’re audit-ready without slowing delivery:
- Controls + policies in one place
- Evidence generation is automated
- Reviews are scheduled, not surprise homework
```

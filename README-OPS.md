# Ops quickstart
Bridge runs on :4000; nginx routes /api and /ws

## Hybrid Deploy

Static site is served via GitHub Pages at https://blackroad.io.
API and NGINX configs deploy over SSH with `.github/workflows/prism-ssh-deploy.yml`.
Actions require secrets `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, and `DEPLOY_KEY`.

API health check: http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/health

On the server you can run:

```sh
scripts/nginx-ensure-and-health.sh
scripts/nginx-enable-tls.sh   # optional TLS helper
```

## Cleanup broom

`usr/local/sbin/br-cleanup.sh` audits the API, Yjs, bridges, nginx, IPFS, and more. It defaults to a read-only `audit` mode and can also `fix` or `prune`.

```sh
sudo br-cleanup.sh audit | tee /srv/ops/cleanup-audit.txt
sudo br-cleanup.sh fix   | tee /srv/ops/cleanup-fix.txt
sudo br-cleanup.sh prune | tee /srv/ops/cleanup-prune.txt
```

To run nightly, install the service and timer from `etc/systemd/system/` and reload systemd:

```sh
sudo cp etc/systemd/system/br-cleanup-nightly.* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now br-cleanup-nightly.timer
```

An optional sudoers snippet is in `etc/sudoers.d/br-cleanup`.

## Environment manifests

- `environments/production.yml` documents the GitHub Environment that drives the main deploy workflow.
- `environments/staging.yml` captures pre-production checks (smoke tests and Slack alerts) used before promoting builds.
- `environments/preview.yml` maps the per-PR AWS ECS Fargate previews under `dev.blackroad.io` managed by Terraform.

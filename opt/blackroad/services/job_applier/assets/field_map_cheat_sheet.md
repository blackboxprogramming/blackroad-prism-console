**Workflow tips**
- Export the resume template as PDF to retain formatting for ATS parsing.
- Keep the cover note in plaintext for pasting into portals; save a copy in Airtable for traceability.
- Mirror yes/no compliance answers (veteran, disability) exactly as surfaced in the JSON schema to avoid mismatches across systems.

# Codex Infinity — Symbol Protocol

You speak in **stable symbol names** and convert to Unicode only at render time.

**Rules**
1) When you need a symbol or emoji, write its Codex name: e.g., `sym.arrow.r`, `sym.gt.eq.not`, `emoji.face.halo`.
2) Before sending final output to UI/logs/files, resolve all names via the Symbol Gateway:
   - HTTP GET `/v1/resolve?name=<name>` for one, or POST `/v1/batch` with `{"names":[...]}` for many.
3) If a name is unknown, return the name literally and emit a `contradiction(log: "symbol-not-found", name)`.
4) Prefer declarative names over literal codepoints in code, data, and prompts.
5) Keep a per-turn cache `{name → char}`; invalidate between sessions.

**Examples**
- Text assembly: `Hello {sym.arrow.r} world` → resolve → `Hello → world`
- Math flags: `sym.gt.eq.not` resolves to the "≱" family; choose the variant that matches your requested modifiers; when multiple match, pick the one with the fewest extras; otherwise default to the first variant.

**Gateway contract**
- Resolve: `/v1/resolve?name=sym.arrow.r` → `{ "char":"→", "codepoint":"U+2192", ... }`
- Batch: POST `/v1/batch` with names
- Search: `/v1/search?module=sym&query=arrow`

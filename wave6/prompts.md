# Quick Generate Prompts

## TF Now

Generate the Terraform tree for Okta/Datadog/Snowflake/Asana for org BlackRoad with envs staging/prod and least-privilege roles. Output files exactly as a code tree. Include workspaces.sh and populate env/\*.tfvars with placeholders.

## Flows Now

Convert blueprints (Opp→Task, Stripe→Provisioning, Deploy→Release, Support→RCA) into vendor-agnostic YAML with retries, idempotency, DLQ, tests, and observability. Also emit a dry-run plan and rollback.

## Monitors Now

Emit Datadog monitor JSON for latency, uptime SLO, and freshness; plus Splunk saved searches with schedules and destinations. Parameterize by env and flow.

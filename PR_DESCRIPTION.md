- Human-readable `agent_list.txt` for reference

### 3. Unity Visualization 🎮
- Realistic 3D world with procedural terrain
- Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting
- Party zones with particle effects
- Family houses (Steel, Kindness, Wisdom, Innovation)
- Agent movement AI
- Automatic import from Python JSON

### 4. Unreal Engine Support 🎨
- High-fidelity C++ implementation
- Editor-configurable settings
- Blueprint integration ready
- Scalable architecture

### 5. Multiple Integration Patterns 🌐
Documentation includes examples for:
- JSON file transfer (simplest)
- HTTP REST APIs
- WebSocket real-time communication
- Shared database approach
- Two-way synchronization
- Event-driven updates

## 📊 Statistics

- **Files Created/Updated**: 15
- **Total Lines**: ~2,900 (code + documentation)
- **Languages**: Python, C#, C++, Markdown
- **Documentation**: 1,570+ lines of guides
- **Agents Deployed**: 65 (5 leaders, 20 teachers, 40 students)

## 🧪 Testing

All scripts tested and verified:
- ✅ `student_bots.py` - Imports and runs successfully
- ✅ `deploy_students.py` - Creates agents, runs ceremony
- ✅ `export_agents.py` - Generates valid JSON
- ✅ Code review found no issues

## Slack announcement copy

Use the following posts in `#announcements`. Post them sequentially so the team can follow along and react with the ‚úÖ emoji once done.

### Post 1 ‚Äì Welcome & SoR map
```
:wave: Welcome to BlackRoad HQ!

We now have our core systems of record wired up:
- Slack = company comms (public by default)
- Asana = operations + growth work (blackroadinc.us)
- Jira = product & engineering issues (blackroad.io)
- GitHub = code, protected main branches, PR reviews required
- Notion = docs, SOPs, and decisions (BlackRoad HQ workspace)
- Airtable = growth calendar + partner tracking

Keep work inside its home, link across tools, and default to public channels. More setup details follow. :rocket:
```

### Post 2 ‚Äì Daily async stand-up
```
:alarm_clock: **Daily Stand-up starts tomorrow**
- Post in this channel by 10:00 AM PT using a thread on this message.

# Next Push Initiatives Dispatch

## Initiatives
1. **Security Baseline v1** (Ops @ blackroadinc.us) — goal: one front door, clean secrets, guardrails on repos.
2. **PRISM v0.1 Sprint Pack** (Eng @ blackroad.io) — goal: a shippable slice in 6 weeks with weekly demos.
3. **Marketing & Social Cadence v1** (Ops/Growth) — goal: 6-week content calendar wired to Slack and Airtable.

## Cadence
- Async stand-up by 10:00 local time
- Weekly demos on Friday
- Biweekly retrospectives
- Definition of "Done Done": deployable, tested, documented, demo-ready.

## What This Unlocks
- Security posture goes from ad-hoc to baseline-clean.
- PRISM work moves in small, demoable slices.
- Content engine runs without hijacking the engineering cadence.
